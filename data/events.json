      "description": "»Sensor Systems for Safety and Security«\nIn most industrialized countries, in particular within Europe, a high level of both safety and security has been reached. However, it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain or to increase this standard even further, given the great challenges and current threats Europe is facing. Upholding and restoring the necessary level of safety and security we are accustomed to requires the development and implementation of innovative technical solutions such as intelligent sensing systems and sensor networks. These hold the promise that hazards and threats can be detected early enough to avoid severe adverse impact, while still allowing people to travel and move freely as well as maintaining free trade and circulation of goods.\n\nAt the same time, smart factories and intelligent logistics based on cyber-physical systems and the internet of things (IoT), also referred to as Industry 4.0, pose new challenges with respect to operational safety. Advanced sensors and sensor networks are required e.g. for the safe operation of autonomous mobile systems.  \n\nTo provide valid solutions to all these challenges, a cross-disciplinary collaboration of researchers from natural sciences, engineering, humanities and social sciences is required. To foster the communication and interaction among these different communities on this very topic, the »Future Security« conference series provides an interdisciplinary exchange platform for scientists, experts and actors from research, industry, public bodies and authorities. This conference provides direct insight into current security research activities and hot topics in this field.    \n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to the 11th »Future Security« Conference.\n\n\n\n"

Nevertheless, the nature and implications of such orderings are far from clear. What exactly is it that algorithms “do”? What is the role attributed to “algorithms” in these arguments? How can we turn the “problem of algorithms” into an object of productive inquiry?\n\nThis conference sets out to explore the recent rise of algorithms as an object of interest in scholarship, policy, and practice. Taking a fresh view on the current wave of interest in the topic, we aim to discuss themes such as:\n\n    the very idea of “algorithms” as a subject and object of analysis\n    issues of methodology and the kind of knowledge claims that come with algorithms\n    the rhetoric of problems and solutions, in which algorithms are mobilized\n    questions of agency and automation\n    conceptions of secrecy or inscrutability\n    normative concerns\n    rules and regulations surrounding development and implementation\n\nThe conference is over now, but you can still sign up for the Mailing list and enjoy the various Resources we assembled.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "In this first year, IEEE Cybersecurity Development (SecDev) 2016 is soliciting short papers that present innovations, experience-based insights, or a vision. The goal is to share useful and thought provoking ideas, to push forward the art and science of secure development. In future years, the academic portion of SecDev will expand to include more complete articles.\n\nSecDev is a new venue for presenting ideas, research, and experience about how to develop secure systems.\n\nSecDev is distinguished by its focus on how to “build security in” (and not simply discover the absence of security). Its goal is to encourage and disseminate ideas for secure system development among both academia and industry. Developers have valuable experiences and ideas that can inform academic research, and researchers have concepts, studies, and even code and tools that could benefit developers. We anticipate that attendees from academic conferences like IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, PLDI, FSE, ISSTA, SOUPS, and many others could contribute ideas to SecDev, as could attendees of industrial conferences like AppSec, RSA, Black Hat, and Shmoocon.\n\nPapers have the option of appearing in the conference’s formal proceedings, or not. SecDev is also interested in tutorials on processes, frameworks, languages, and tools. The goal is to propose useful and thought provoking ideas, and to share knowledge on the art and science of secure system development.\n\nAreas of interest include (but are not limited to):\n* Security engineering processes, from requirements to maintenance\n* Dynamic/static analysis and runtime approaches towards application security\n* Programming languages and frameworks supporting security\n* Testing strategies to ensure security\n* Explorations of formal verification and other high-assurance methods for security\n* Code reviews, red teams, and other human-centered assurance\n* Security-focused system (HW/SW/architecture) designs\n* Human-centered design for systems security\n* Distributed systems design and implementation for security\n\nWhat makes SecDev different than other conferences?\nSecDev is interested in work that has a demonstrated connection to building systems that are more secure. It is not enough to show that an existing system, however prominent, is insecure. Nor is it enough to propose a new cryptosystem or formal security model with nice mathematical properties but no concrete exploration of how it would be used to build systems more securely. Instead, papers should be about (as a few examples) how a development library, tool, or process can produce systems resilient against certain attacks; how a formal foundation could underpin a language, tool, or testing strategy that can help produce stronger systems; and experience, designs, or applications showing how cryptography can be used effectively to secure systems.\n\nA good SecDev paper may resemble an elaborated vision statement, a grant proposal, or a mini-keynote summarizing prior work and directions. We are not interested in complete works that manage to fit in a few pages; rather we want bigger ideas (previously published or not) that will lead to a stimulating, thoughtful, and perhaps (gently) provocative discussion. A good SecDev tutorial will introduce interested practitioners and researchers to technologies (e.g., languages, tools, frameworks) that show promise in aiding the development of secure systems.\n\n\n\n"

Participants also included experts involved in drafting the recently-enacted identity legislation in the EU and Virginia, and experts currently involved in planned and proposed upcoming legislative initiatives relating to identity management in both the U.S. and internationally.\nThe impetus for the meeting was several recent developments relating to identity management legislation. They included the following recently adopted identity management legislation:\n• The European Union eIDAS Regulation adopted in 2014, and\n• The Virginia Electronic Identity Management Act adopted in 2015;\nand the following planned or proposed projects to develop new identity management legislation:\n• The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (International) project to develop international rules providing “a basic legal framework covering identity management transactions;”\n• The Uniform Law Commission (United States) proposal to develop uniform identity management legislation for the 50 U.S. states; and\n• The Virginia Identity Management Standards Advisory Council (Virginia) project to advise the Virginia Secretary of Technology on the identity management standards to be adopted as regulations in Virginia under its new Identity Management Act.\n\nThe goal of the meeting was to discuss the direction that such new identity management legislation should take, the issues it should address, and desired approaches.\nA key theme reiterated throughout the event was the importance of focusing on outcome-based legislation. Participants voiced concern that legislation prescribing a specific technical process to implement identity standards would hinder innovation and ultimately prevent the success of a new legal regime.\nThis Report summarizes at a high-level the robust, thought-provoking and productive discussion in which the participants engaged.\n\n\n\n"
