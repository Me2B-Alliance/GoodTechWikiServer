As such, we are taking a keen interest in the ICO’s Age Appropriate Design Code. We are also engaging with the Government in its White Paper on Online Harms, and note the connection between these initiatives. Whilst we recognise and support the ICO’s aims of protecting and upholding children’s rights online, we have severe concerns that as currently drafted the Code will not achieve these objectives. There is a real risk that implementation of the Code will result in widespread age verification across websites, apps and other online services, which will lead to increased data profiling of both children and adults, and restrictions on their freedom of expression and access to information.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "The Jericho Forum Identity, Entitlement & Access Management (IdEA) Commandments define the principles that must be observed when planning an identity eco-system.\nWhilst building on “good practice”, these commandments specifically address those areas that will allow “identity” processes to operate on a global, de-perimeterised scale; this necessitates open and interoperable standards and a commitment to implement such standards by both identity providers and identity consumers\n.\nThe IdEA commandments serve as a benchmark by which Identity, Entitlement and Access Management concepts, solutions, standards and systems can be assessed and measured. They are supported by a Jericho Forum IdEA Glossary and other related documents. They also build on the higher level Jericho Forum Commandments, in particular Commandments 2, 8, 9 and 10.\n\nIdentity and Core Identity\n1. All core identities must be protected to ensure their secrecy and integrity\n2. Identifiers must be able to be trusted\n3. The authoritative source of identity will be the unique identifier or credentials offered by the persona representing that entity\n\nMultiple Identities (Persona)\n4. An Entity can have multiple, separate Persona (Identities) and related\nunique identifiers\n5. Persona must, in specific use cases, be able to be seen as the same\n\nPersona (Identity) Attributes\n6. The attribute owner is responsible for the protection and appropriate\ndisclosure of the attribute\n7. Connecting attributes to persona must be simple and verifiable\n8. The source of the attribute should be as close to the authoritative source as\npossible\n\nEntitlement management and resource access\n9. A resource owner must define Entitlement (Resource Access Rules)\n10.Access decisions must be relevant, valid and bi-directional\n\nUsage and Delegation\n11. Users of an entity’s attributes are accountable for protecting the attributes\n12.Principals can delegate authority to another to act on behalf of a persona\n13.Authorised Principals may acquire access to (seize) another entity’s persona\n14.A persona may represent, or be represented by, more than one entity \n\nConclusion\nThe shift from Enterprise and Application or System Centric Identity and Access Management to User and Resource Centric Identity, Entitlement and Access Management holds the triple promises of Lower Cost, Higher Security/Trust and Increased Flexibility. These benefits will have a major positive impact on the way the world will innovate and trade. The new frame must however be managed with the context created by these Commandments to gain these benefits.\n\nThere is also a major infrastructure investment required to create the next generation “Identity” Management approach. This investment in turn requires a shift in the business model and the enthusiastic uptake of the services that will encourage a cultural shift that will value Transparency as much as it does Privacy. Open access to the reputation of entities will go a long way to raising the eTrust barrier.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "“A social network service focuses on the building and verifying of online social networks for commu- nities of people who share interests and activities, or who are interested in exploring the interests and activities of others, and which necessitates the use of software. Most services are primarily web based and provide a collection of various ways for users to interact [...]”1. Specifically, many popular sites offer means to interact with other subscribers (based on self-generated personal profiles2).\nThe advent and ever increasing popularity of social network services heralds a sea change in the way personal data of large populations of citizens all over the world become more or less publicly available. These services have become incredibly popular in the past years especially with young people. But increasingly such services are also being offered e.g. for professionals and the elderly.\nThe challenges posed by social network services are on the one hand yet another flavour of the fun- damental changes that the introduction of the Internet in the 90s of the past century has brought with it, by – inter alia – abolishing time and space in publishing information and real-time communication, and by blurring the line between service providers (authors) on the one hand and users/consumers (readers) on the other.\nAt the same time, social networking services seem to be pushing at the boundaries of what societies see as a person’s individual space: Personal data about individuals become publicly (and globally) available in an unprecedented way and quantity3, especially including huge quantities of digital pic- tures and videos.\nWith respect to privacy, one of the most fundamental challenges may be seen in the fact that most of the personal information published in social network services is being published at the initiative of the users and based on their consent. While ”traditional” privacy regulation is concerned with defin- ing rules to protect citizens against unfair or unproportional processing of personal data by the public administration (including law enforcement and secret services), and businesses, there are only very few rules governing the publication of personal data at the initiative of private individuals, partly be- cause this had not been a major issue in the “offline world”, and neither on the Internet before social network services came into being. Furthermore, the processing of personal data from public sources has traditionally been privileged in data protection and privacy legislation.\n\n\n\n"

Each of us was deeply hurt by the physical violence of these attacks on our democratic values, on what unites us and binds us, and which is the cornerstone of our identity as French and European citizens. These humanistic values hold special meaning for the CNIL’s 200 staff members and 17 Commissioners.  Since then, the cursor between security requirements and the defence of fundamental freedoms has unquestionably shifted. In this very particular context, underscored by intense emotion, the CNIL has maintained its course, seeking a delicate balance between disparate but not necessarily antagonistic requirements. Over and above their individual and collective impacts, these events have had a very direct impact on the CNIL’s activity. The Commission has had to issue opinions on 14 texts (implementing decrees and bills) related to coun-ter-terrorism measures or intelligence. While some of them were already planned, the attacks clearly hastened their implementation.\n\n\n\n"

Furthermore, these regimes prescribe that companies will not use data for purposes other than the purposes for which they were collected, called use limitation, except for legal purposes and when the user provides consent. To help companies write better privacy requirements that embody the use limitations and collection limitation principles, we conducted a case study to identify how purpose is expressed among five privacy policies from the shopping domain. Using content analysis, we discovered six exclusive data purpose categories. In addition, we observed natural language patterns to express purpose. Finally, we found that data purpose specificity varies with the specificity of information type descriptions. We believe this taxonomy and the patterns can help policy analysts discover missing or underspecified purposes to better comply with the collection and use limitation principles.\n\n\n\n"

DIDs are supported by the W3C community [14] and the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) [16]. They are the \"atomic units\" of a new layer of decentralized identity infrastructure. However, DIDs can be extended from identifers for people to any entity, thus identifying everything. We can use DIDs to help us identify and manage objects, machines, or agents through their digital twins; we can expand them to locations, to events, and even to pure data objects, which we refer to as decentralized autonomic data (DAD) items [1][3].\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "In recent years, developments in genomics technologies have led to the rise of commercial personal genome testing (PGT): broad genome-wide testing for multiple diseases simultaneously. While some commercial providers require physicians to order a personal genome test, others can be accessed directly. All providers advertise directly to consumers and offer genetic risk information about dozens of diseases in one single purchase. The quantity and the complexity of risk information pose challenges to adequate pre-test and post-test information provision and informed consent. There are currently no guidelines for what should constitute informed consent in PGT or how adequate informed consent can be achieved. In this paper, we propose a tiered-layered-staged model for informed consent. First, the proposed model is tiered as it offers choices between categories of diseases that are associated with distinct ethical, personal or societal issues. Second, the model distinguishes layers of information with a first layer offering minimal, indispensable information that is material to all consumers, and additional layers offering more detailed information made available upon request. Finally, the model stages informed consent as a process by feeding information to consumers in each subsequent stage of the process of undergoing a test, and by accommodating renewed consent for test result updates, resulting from the ongoing development of the science underlying PGT. A tiered-layered-staged model for informed consent with a focus on the consumer perspective can help overcome the ethical problems of information provision and informed consent in direct-to-consumer PGT.\n\n\n\n"

Another happy moment was theCommission’s budget extension granted by the Prime Minister, thereby comfortingthe trend initiated since 2004.Not so pleasant was the time when the Warsmann amendment nearly jeopardisedthat very same budget for a few hours...Another highlight, this one neither good nor bad but a true milestone, was thepublication of our audit report on the STIC system.Lastly, we should mention one disappointment at not having convinced thecommission in charge of revising the Preamble to the 1958 Constitution of the needto constitutionalise the right to personal data protection.A source of great satisfaction is the realisation that our Commission is increasinglypresent in major societal debates, increasingly approached by public authorities, andincreasingly heard by our fellow citizens.\n\n\n\n"

Users can use implementations of ActivityPub like Mastodon and MediaGoblin as libre alternatives to large siloed socialnetworking systems such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram1.In general ActivityPub follows the client-server paradigm that has been popular on the World Wide Web, while restoring some level of decentralization. Current implementations of ActivityPub go as far as to bring a level of decentralization akin to email2, but there are many opportunities to go further.By attaching public keys to the profles of actors (users) on the network and using Linked Data Signatures, we can add a web of trust to the federated social web and use it to enhance user privacy and to assert the integrity ofmessages sent over the network.By using a decentralized identifer system such as Decentralized Identifers (DIDs) we can move fully from a decentralized to a distributed system3, by escaping the core centralization mechanisms of DNS and SSL certifcate authorities.At this point, users could even optionally transition from a client-server model system to a fully peer-to-peer system\n\n\n\n"

We have raised concern about bias, assumptionsand the potential for negative or restrictive conclusions being drawn,which could cause individuals harm. Algorithms, the toolsused to analyse big data,are clearly part of this concern. 2.Firstly,not all data is good data.Rather than encouraging “big data” analytics, we should be encouraging “relevant data”and “proportionate data”analytics, especially in the context of those made by or carried out in relation to Government and public bodies.3.Whilst some algorithms are designed to provide yes/no answers, increasingly that is not the sole purpose.   Indeed as we have seen from therecent “Growing the Artificial Intelligence Industry in the UK”1paper published by the Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the push appears to be for algorithms to infiltrate and impact every corner of our data driven lives.  We feel profoundlynervous of such proposals and stress that caution is applied to the optimism of a perfect world which the paper tends to err towards.  4.Firstly human beings are nuanced.  There is no such thing as one size fits all in terms of people.  All legislative decisions will have positive and negative outcomes depending on how the law impacts the individual.  Whilst broad laws are necessary to help society to function, the role of using algorithms to offer precision to those laws is not necessarily going to provide better outcomes.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "D&S fellow Mark Latonero considers recent attempts by policymakers, big tech companies, and advocates to address the deepening refugee and migrant crisis and, in particular, the educational needs of displaced children through technology and app development projects. He cautions developers and policymakers to consider the risks of failing to understand the unique challenges facing refugee children living without running water, let alone a good mobile network.\n\n    The reality is that no learning app or technology will improve education by itself. It’s also questionable whether mobile apps used with minimal adult supervision can improve a refugee child’s well-being. A roundtable at the Brookings Center for Universal Education noted that “children have needs that cannot be addressed where there is little or no human interaction. A teacher is more likely to note psychosocial needs and to support children’s recovery, or to refer children to other services when they are in greater contact with children.” Carleen Maitland, a technology and policy professor who led the Penn State team, found through her experience at Zaatari that in-person interactions with instructors and staff in the camp’s many community centers could provide far greater learning opportunities for young people than sitting alone with a mobile app.\n\n    In fact, unleashing ed tech vendors or Western technologists to solve development issues without the appropriate cultural awareness could do more harm than good. Children could come to depend on technologies that are abandoned by developers once the attention and funding have waned. Plus, the business models that sustain apps through advertising, or collecting and selling consumer data, are unethical where refugees are concerned. Ensuring data privacy and security for refugee children using apps should be a top priority for any software developer.\n\n    In cases where no in-person education is available, apps can still play a role, particularly for children who feel unsafe to travel outside their shelters or are immobile owing to injuries or disabilities. But if an app is to stand a chance of making a real difference, it needs to arise not out of a tech meet-up in New York City but on a field research trip to a refugee camp, where it will be easier to see how mobile phones are actually accessed and used. Researchers need to ask basic questions about the value of education for refugees: Is the goal to inspire learning on traditional subjects? Empower students with academic credentials or job skills? Assimilate refugees into their host country? Provide a protected space where children can be fed and feel safe? Or combat violent extremism at an early age?\n\n    To decide, researchers need to put the specific needs of refugee children first—whether economic, psychosocial, emotional, or physical—and work backward to see whether technology can help, if at all.\n\n\n\n"

The way these control mechanisms are implemented can significantly affect individuals’ choices and their privacy outcomes. We present an extensive content analysis of a stratified sample of 150 English-language websites, assessing the usability and interaction paths of their data deletion options and opt-outs for email communications and targeted advertising. This heuristic evaluation identified substantial issues that likely make exercising these privacy choices on many websites difficult and confusing for US-based consumers. Even though the majority of analyzed websites offered privacy choices, they were located inconsistently across websites. Furthermore, some privacy choices were rendered unusable by missing or unhelpful information, or by links that did not lead to the stated choice. Based on our findings, we provide insights for addressing usability issues in the end-to-end interaction required to effectively exercise privacy choices and controls.\n\n\n\n"

However, users rarely read them and struggle to understand their con-tents. Also, the entities that provide these policies are sometimes unmotivated to make them com-prehensible.  Recently, annotated corpora of privacy policies have been introduced to the researchcommunity.   They open the door to the development of machine learning and natural languageprocessing techniques to automate the annotation of these documents.  In turn, these annotationscan be passed on to interfaces (e.g., web browser plugins) that help users quickly identify and un-derstand relevant privacy statements. We present advances in extracting privacy policy paragraphs(termedsegmentsin this paper) and individual sentences that relate to expert-identified categoriesof policy contents, using methods in supervised learning. In particular, we show that relevant seg-ments and sentences can be classified with average micro-F1 scores of 0.78 and 0.66 respectively,improving over prior work.  We discuss how the techniques introduced in this paper have beenused to automatically annotate the text of about 7,000 privacy policies.  Our discussion highlightsopportunities as well as limitations associated with our classification approach.\n\n\n\n"

If terminology is inconsistent or ambiguous, however, these models and their conclusions will be unreliable. To study this problem, we investigated an approach to automatically construct an information type ontology by identifying information type hyponymy in privacy policies using Tregex patterns. Tregex is a utility to match regular expressions against constituency parse trees, which are hierarchical expressions of natural language clauses, including noun and verb phrases. We discovered the Tregex patterns by applying content analysis to 30 privacy policies from six domains (shopping, telecommunication, social networks, employment, health, and news.) From this dataset, three semantic and four lexical categories of hyponymy emerged based on category completeness and word-order. Among these, we identified and empirically evaluated 72 Tregex patterns to automate the extraction of hyponyms from privacy policies. The patterns match information type hyponyms with an average precision of 0.72 and recall of 0.74.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "ACM Transactions on the Web, 13, 1, Dec 2018\n\nWebsite privacy policies are often long and difficult to understand. While research shows that Internet userscare about their privacy, they do not have the time to understand the policies of every website they visit,and most users hardly ever read privacy policies. Some recent efforts have aimed to use a combination ofcrowdsourcing, machine learning, and natural language processing to interpret privacy policies at scale, thusproducing annotations for use in interfaces that inform Internet users of salient policy details. However,little attention has been devoted to studying the accuracy of crowdsourced privacy policy annotations, howcrowdworker productivity can be enhanced for such a task, and the levels of granularity that are feasible forautomatic analysis of privacy policies. In this article, we present a trajectory of work addressing each of thesetopics. We include analyses of crowdworker performance, evaluation of a method to make a privacy-policyoriented task easier for crowdworkers, a coarse-grained approach to labeling segments of policy text withdescriptive themes, and a fine-grained approach to identifying user choices described in policy text. Together,the results from these efforts show the effectiveness of using automated and semi-automated methods forextracting from privacy policies the data practice details that are salient to Internet users’ interests\n\n\n\n"

Newsworthy events, including those involving Facebook’s API and Cambridge Analytica obtaining information about millions of Facebook users, have highlighted the technical capabilities of APIs for prominent websites and mobile applications. At the same time, media coverage of ways that APIs have been misused has sparked concern for potential privacy invasions and other issues of public policy. This paper seeks to educate consumers on how APIs work and how they are used within popular websites and mobile apps to gather, share, and utilize data.APIs are used in mobile games, search engines, social media platforms, news and shopping websites, video and music streaming services, dating apps, and mobile payment systems. If a third-party company, like an app developer or advertiser, would like to gain access to your information through a website you visit or a mobile app or online service you use, what data might they obtain about you through APIs and how? This report analyzes 11 prominent online services to observe general trends and provide you an overview of the role APIs play in collecting and distributing information about consumers. For example, how might your data be gathered and shared when using your Facebook account login to sign up for Venmo or to access the Tinder dating app? How might advertisers use Pandora’s API when you are streaming music?\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Big Brother Watch present a timely report highlighting the competing tensions faced by local authorities when delivering public space video surveillance. The pressure on public services caused by austerity versus the future challenges of emerging technology are neatly addressed through analysis of recent spending patterns. Despite the reduction in spending highlighted in this report I am certain that new and advancing technologies will see further investment by local authorities to deliver new and exciting capabilities; from smart cities to smarter surveillance, the use of video analytics and algorithms to help protect its citizens from crime, support the night time economy and ensure free passage of traffic in our cities and towns. The sums of money involved are massive and it’s important that those charged with delivering this service get it right.My team is developing a process –a 'Passport to Compliance' –which will allow local authorities to follow an incremental and intelligent approach to considering whether a new surveillance camera system is essential. It begins with the question; “why do we want surveillance cameras and is there a legitimate and pressing need for them?” It will provide a framework and guidance schedule to ensure that every pound of public money spent on surveillance camera systems is spent wisely. It will ensure local authorities comply with the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice. This report neatly highlights the imperative of implementing such a process.\n\n\n\n"

She also asks us to consider who benefits, and who loses, from a technologically mediated world.\n\n    Just as recommendation systems result in differentiated experiences online, creating dynamics where one person’s view of the internet radically differs from another’s, so too will personalized learning platforms.\n\n    More than anything, what personalized learning brings to the table for me is the stark reality that our society must start grappling with the ways we are both interconnected and differentiated. We are individuals and we are part of networks.\n\n    In the realm of education, we cannot and should not separate these two. By recognizing our interconnected nature, we might begin to fulfill the promises that technology can offer our students.\n\n\n\n"

ATTPS supported TDL in addressing the relationship and balance between the business, legal, social and technical aspects of a public trust platform as well as pragmatic actions such as developing and the testing of generic trust architectures and integration pilots. ATTPS strengthened TDL’s road-mapping by implementing and supporting the SRA and actively contributed to the awareness raising for trustworthy ICT solutions\nPriority was given to stimulating and organising the interplay between technology development and legal, social, and economic research through multi-disciplinary research communities; promoting standards, certification and best practices as well as the coordination of national RTD activities.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "NDSS'17: Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, Feb 2017\n\nAbstract—Mobile apps have to satisfy various privacy require-ments.  Notably,  app  publishers  are  often  obligated  to  provide  aprivacy  policy  and  notify  users  of  their  apps’  privacy  practices.But  how  can  a  user  tell  whether  an  app  behaves  as  its  policypromises?  In  this  study  we  introduce  a  scalable  system  to  helpanalyze   and   predict   Android   apps’   compliance   with   privacyrequirements.  We  discuss  how  we  customized  our  system  in  acollaboration with the California Office of the Attorney General.Beyond its use by regulators and activists our system is also meantto  assist  app  publishers  and  app  store  owners  in  their  internalassessments of privacy  requirement  compliance.Our analysis of 17,991 free Android apps shows the viabilityof combining machine learning-based privacy policy analysis withstatic code analysis of apps. Results suggest that 71% of apps thatlack  a  privacy  policy  should  have  one.  Also,  for  9,050  apps  thathave a policy, we find many instances of potential inconsistenciesbetween  what  the  app  policy  seems  to  state  and  what  the  codeof  the  app  appears  to  do.  In  particular,  as  many  as  41%  ofthese  apps  could  be  collecting  location  information  and  17%could be sharing such with third parties without disclosing so intheir policies. Overall, each app exhibits a mean of 1.83 potentialprivacy  requirement  inconsistencie\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "New Data & Society ethnographic report Beyond Disruption uses interviews with over 100 domestic and ridehailing platform workers in major U.S. cities to reveal how technology is reshaping the future of labor.\n\nWhile ridehail driving and other male-dominated sectors have been at the forefront in conversations about the future of work, the working lives of domestic workers like housecleaners and nannies usually aren’t included.\n\nBeyond Disruption featured in The New York Times\n\n“Nannies, elder care workers, and housecleaners might have years of experience, but that isn’t enough to thrive on a marketplace platform.”\n\n–Alex Rosenblat\n“There’s an App for Wrecking Nannies’ Lives”\n\nBy bringing these three types of platforms and workers together, this report complicates simple narratives about technology’s impact on labor markets and highlights the convergent and divergent challenges workers face when using labor platforms to find and carry out their work. Interviewees reported increased financial and personal risk due to platform policy and design loopholes. For example, workers with marginalized identities (e.g. people of color and undocumented workers; largely women) report inequitable conditions that arise from common features such as rating systems.\n\n\n\n"

New    technology    and    automated    systems,    encompassing    artificial intelligence, machine learningand big data analyticsare being used ever more widely in the criminal  justice  system.  These  are  being  used  to  predict  communities  to  target  with greater police  resources;  to  assess  individuals’risk  of  committing  crimes  in  the  future;  to  identify suspects in public places; and to supportpolice investigations.However,  these  new  systems  have  evidenced  some  extremely  concerning  biases.  There  are significant problems with the data being used to build and train these models, while some of those  building  the  models  have  shownlittle  regard  for  data  protection  or  human  rights.  This has  resulted  in  biased  and  discriminatory decisionsthat  are  in  large  part  automated,  with serious implications for the fairness of criminal justice. The protections afforded to individuals subject  to  these  biased,  unfair  or  unjust decisions  are  minimal.  Many  will  never  even  be aware they have been subject to such an automated decision.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "In this short submission, we focus on Durham Police’s use of the ‘Harm Assessment Risk Tool’(HART).   HART   is   an   artificially   intelligent   algorithmic   tool   used   to   make   recidivism   riskassessments about suspects and inform prosecution decisions. It was developed by DurhamPolice in conjunction with academics and has been in use since 2017. The AI risk predictions guide decisions as to whether a suspect should be charged or releasedonto the ‘Checkpoint’ rehabilitation programme. Moderate risk’ suspects are informed that ifthey successfully complete the Checkpoint programme they will not receive a criminal convictionWe focus on this tool because it is one of the most significant examples of algorithms in thejustice system in the UK, and was the topic of an investigation by Big Brother Watch in 2018. Webelieve that Durham Police’s creation and use of HART exemplifies many of the risks associatedwith rapid application of algorithms in the justice system: risks of discrimination, privacyintrusion, de facto automated decision making and profiling, as well as erosion of trust in lawenforcement.\n\n\n\n"

Biometric recognition has been applied to identification of criminals, patient tracking in medical informatics, and the personalization of social services, among other things. In spite of substantial effort, however, there remain unresolved questions about the effectiveness and management of systems for biometric recognition, as well as the appropriateness and societal impact of their use. Moreover, the general public has been exposed to biometrics largely as high-technology gadgets in spy thrillers or as fear-instilling instruments of state or corporate surveillance in speculative fiction.\n\n\n\n"

Secondly, we raise the issue that the custody image database is oversized and is highly likely to retain images unlawfully. The antiquateddatabase of 21 million photos stores imagesof innocent people who neither received a conviction nor are of any policing interest. The storage of such photos was ruled unlawful in 2012 by the High Court in RMC and FJ v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and Secretary of State for the Home Department. However, it is this database with which facial recognition technology is used by police.\n\n\n\n"

The terms of reference were for Mr Anderson to “examine the operational case” for the bulk powers in Parts 6 and 7 of the Investigatory Powers Bill. Mr Anderson was not required, in his words, to “opine” on what safeguards would be appropriate or if the proposed safeguards in the Bill are proportionate. Mr Anderson was supported in his work by three team members.  Dr Bob Mowill a former Director of Technology and Engineering at GCHQ but now an independent security consultant, Gordon Meldrum former Director of Intelligence at the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Cathryn McGahey QC, barrister and QC in criminal and civil cases. The Report also presented 69 case studies where powers have been used or, in the case of bulk equipment interference, examples of how the power would be used. The report was published on the 10thAugust 2016.\n\n\n\n"

The use of publicly available, corporate, and government data sets may reveal human practices, behaviors, and interactions in unintended ways, creating the need for new kinds of ethical support. Secondary data use invokes privacy and consent concerns. A team at Data & Society recently conducted interviews and campus visits with computer science researchers and librarians at eight U.S. universities to examine the role of research librarians in assisting technical researchers as they navigate emerging issues of privacy, ethics, and equitable access to data at different phases of the research process.\n\n\n\n"

Often, these data are subsequently given to third parties and used for tracking and advertising purposes. Even though such practices are usually specified in the associated Terms and Conditions, these are complex legal documents that most people don’t actually read.\n\nWe believe in a world where private data are protected from unjustified access and where people are truly aware of the privacy-related ramifications of using different devices or digital services. To realize this vision, we propose a crowdsourcing solution that will harness the power of the masses to improve the awareness of people on the content of Terms and Conditions, as well as to explicate the community’s related expectations, thereby exerting pressure on developers in supporting such expectations.\n\nEverybody can be part of our community.

Reacting to the court’s decision, Jacqui Smith - then Home Secretary - said that \"the existing law will remain in place while we carefully consider the judgement.\" In the  Crime  and  Security  Bill,  the Government has  proposed  placing a  cap  of  6  years  on  the  retention  of  the DNA of innocent people if there is no further police interest in the person involved.Earlier this year the Conservatives released figures which exposed the massive discrepancy in how police forces  in  England  and  Wales  respond  to  requests  to  remove  DNA  profiles.  Although  there  are  an  estimated  one  million  innocent  people  on  the  national  DNA  database,  it  is  not  known  how  many  innocent  profiles  are  being  added  by  each  police  force  and  how  many  of  those  are  being  removed  without  being  prompted.

Research has shownthat few users take the time to read these policies, as they areoften long and difficult to understand. In addition, users oftenonly care about a small subset of issues discussed in privacypolicies, and some of the issues they actually care about maynot even be addressed in the text of the policies. Rather thanrequiring users to read the policies, a better approach might beto allow them to simply ask questions about those issues theycare about, possibly through iterative dialog. In this work, wetake a step towards this goal by exploring the idea of an au-tomated privacy question-answering assistant, and look at thekinds of questions users are likely to pose to such a system.This analysis is informed by an initial study that elicits pri-vacy questions from crowdworkers about the data practicesof mobile apps. We analyze 1350 questions posed by crowd-workers  about  the  privacy  practices  of  a  diverse  cross  sec-tion of mobile applications. This analysis sheds some lighton privacy issues mobile app users are likely to inquire aboutas well as their ability to articulate questions in this domain.Our findings in turn should help inform the design of futureprivacy question answering systems.\n\n\n\n"

The devices we use, and the way we use the internet, have changed drastically since then. Updating CIPA, or replacing it to govern these new devices and connections being used by students could do more harm than good. Keeping pornography out of student’s schoolrooms is important, but filtering and monitoring student’s internet activity around town and at home blurs the role of school administrators.”\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "A number of developing countries have decided to implement electronic identity programs to uniquely establish their citizen’s identity, and to achieve solid development outputs, through the efficient delivery of both private and public services. eIDs bring security and convenience, and contribute to the acceleration of economic and social development in developing countries. However, in order to allow the population to fully benefit from these initiatives an integrated approach - that includes civil registration - has to be taken into consideration.\nThe civil register is the foundational registry at the center of an ID ecosystem. It cannot be replaced by identity programs but it can be deeply strengthened by them. A holistic approach, with a circular and dynamic link between civil registration and eID systems, is the only way to reach universal coverage while providing robust credentials.\n\nMany organizations, among which the United Nations and the World Bank for example, provide recommendations and funding to countries that need them. It is crucial that such advice and initiatives for the sustainable implementation of an eCivil registration include the right balance between legislative guidance, technical requirements and organizational support.\nThe establishment of a legal and administrative framework needs to empower a competent and independent agency to drive the modernization for the civil registry. When jurisdictional culture and national laws allow for it, a centralized organization can facilitate communication between information systems and enable nationwide harmonization of registration and data standards. Moreover, safeguards and integrity of collected data must be included in this legislation from the very beginning.\n\nThe switch to the digitalization of civil registration records is crucial to implementing a secured national identity platform. Indeed, computerization allows interoperability with mobile and card technologies. It provides an efficient tool to extend the coverage of registration and identification, and streamlines processes and securely stores data. It is also a strong enabler for the production of continuous and complete vital statistics. The adequate training of civil officers is also a key step in the modernization of the civil registration.\n\nThe use of the Personal Identification Number (PIN) given at birth or during ad-hoc census, and shared across different government databases, can provide a common and neutral entry to retrieve other identification elements in databases to ensure convenience, security and accuracy. As soon as the capture of biometric data is feasible, their association with this number will strengthen the reliability of the identity assertion.\n\n\n\n"

From concerns about who is viewing the images to the broader question of acclimatising children to an environment where surveillance is the norm, it is not a topic to be taken lightly.Our research highlights how, as with local authorities, the use of CCTV varies massively from school to school. While of course local discretion is not a bad thing, the scale of variation does question how strategically CCTV is being used. Yet again CCTV appears to be used as a quick fix to much morecomplex problems and issues that simply cannot be solved with passive surveillance.  With some schools seeing a ratio of one camera for every five pupils, more than two hundred schools using CCTV in bathrooms and changing roomsand more cameras inside school buildings as outside, the picture across the country will undoubtedly shock and surprise many. To put into context the number of cameras, our research earlier this year found there are currently at least 51,600 CCTV cameras controlled by 428 local authorities. Indeed, one of the key questions that arises from this report is the oversight of schools by local authorities and how the situation has reached this level without any concerns being raised.\n\n\n\n"

Your memories of school may be of chalk boards and scribbling down lessons in a workbook.  Answering a question meant putting your hand up, whilst talking to a friend, or enemy, was done by scrawling on scraps of paper.  Information came from books and encyclopaedias not theinternet, in fact the only time you may have used a computer was in a specific information technology lesson and even then there weren’t enough computers for every student to have a go. That vision of school is already out of date and will soon be obsolete.  The analogue classroom of old has been replaced with smartboards, internet connected devices and communication via instant message.  And rightly so.  Learning in the 21st century must revolve around technology in order to teach children the skills required for a digital life in a digital society. The challenges of the modern classroom have changed.  Ensuring that education is connected but that children aren’t involved in cyber bullying, sexting or exposed to online extremism is a daily challenge for schools and teachers alike.  Whilst the internet offers huge potential for learning the opportunity for distraction is never far away.  Simply making sure a class is focused becomes a different proposition when pupils can work on screens hidden from the teachers gaze.  So what are the options available for schools to address these concerns?\n\n\n\n"

On one hand, it aims to guarantee a fresh approach to standards in the following domains: 5G, IoT, Cybersecurity, Cloud and Big Data.\n\nOn the other, it tries to ensure that all forces in Europe pull in the same direction, using standardisation as a strategic instrument to EU industrial policy\n\nInitial reaction to the Communication has been positive – with praise especially from the European Council, the European Parliament and the Standardisation bodies. But the hard work is starting only now – we now need to make it happen.\n\n\n\n"

Accordingly,  in  March  2016,  the  CNIL  created  a  working  group  on  the  “connected  vehicles”  compliance package.The  compliance  package  has  been  elaborated  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  from  the  automobile  sector,  businesses  in  the  insurance  and  telecoms  sectors,  as  well  as  public authorities, in order to propose a sectorial reference framework, a toolbox for the responsible use of personal data.The  challenge  is  to  incorporate  the  “protection  of  personal  data”  dimension  from  the  product  design  phase,  and  to  ensure  that  car  users  enjoy  transparency  and  control  in  relation to their data. Such an approach helps to strengthen user confidence, and thus the long-term development of those technologies.The   guidelines   that   emerge   from   the   compliance   package   constitute   the   CNIL’s   interpretation  of  the  French  Data  Protection  Act,  as  applied  to  connected  vehicles.  They  reflect the analytical frameworks used by the CNIL to assess possible breaches of the law, and they constitute an element of legal security for data controllers.\n\n\n\n"

This is the case of applications for which the data: remain confined within communi-cation networks fully under the user’s control (such as Wi-Fi or another local network); or circulate in public telecommunication networks (such as ADSL, fibre, GSM).For  example:  a  smartphone  appli-cation used by the data subject, which communicates  directly  with  the  ap-pliances installed within their home.The fact that the data are transmitted on networks managed by electronic com-munications operators does not pose any difficulties insofar as these operators have stringent obligations as to what they can do with such traffic data. This is however only valid if the operator in question acts as the provider of the electronic commu-nication service. Conversely, if the opera-tor wishes to provide another service, the applicable recommendations are those for Scenarios 2 or 3.\n\n\n\n"

Clearly this is an issue and law enforcement has tobe able to respond effectively. Key to helping the police deal with the risingnumber ofconcerns is the idea of registering drones. Without a workable system of registration for privately used drones it could be argued that very little progresscanbe made towards policing their use or making sure they are flown in a legal way. Registration is a process which needs to be given serious consideration sooner rather than later. The longer a system takes toimplement the more drones willneed to be registered retrospectivelyincreasingthe administrative burdens needed to make the system effective.Whilst speed is of the essence it shouldn’t be an excuse to cut corners. Whatever system is introduced has to inspire confidence in both members of the public and users, be sensible, easyto administerand easy to promote.\n\n\n\n"

The Credential Handler API enables websites to install Credential Handlers that can respond when users visit other websites that request or store credentials.\n\nFor example, a user may visit a website that wants them to login using OpenIdConnect, provide an OAuth Token, authenticate using a DID, or present some Verifiable Credentials. When these other websites use the Credential Handler API, the user is shown an in-browser selection screen with visual representations (e.g. icons and origin information) of only those Credential Handlers that they have been previously installed by the user and that are compatible with the website's request. Once the user makes a choice, the appropriate Credential Handler is loaded and a credential event is sent to it.\n\nThe Credential Handler receives the event via a Service Worker or, if the Credential Handler Polyfill is used, a simple page with no UI elements is loaded that uses the polyfill to receive and respond to the event.\n\nThe Credential Handler must respond to the event with a credential that fulfills the request. If necessary, the Credential Handler may open a window on its website's origin to allow the user to interact with its website prior to responding. This UI can be styled and shaped according to the website owner's brand using arbitrary JavaScript and HTML like any other webpage.\n\n\n\n"

The number  of  serious  cyberattacks isforecasted  to  significantly  rise  in  the  near  future, making cybersecurityrisks a clear priority.But is cybersecurity being appropriately prioritised by local authorities, or is more data collection themain focus of theirdigital strategies?Based on  Freedom of Information  requests,Big  Brother  Watchfound  thatUK local authorities have experiencedin excess of98 million cyberattacks over 5 years.This meansthat there are at least37 attempted breachesof UK local authoritiesevery minute.

At that Forum, the foundations were laid for a new joint endeavour to explore opportunities and identify good practices for enhancing data interoperability in the area of sustainable development.\n\nThese aims are today embodied in the Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability, established in March 2017 at a side-event to the 48th UN Statistical Commission and convened by the UN Statistical Division (UNSD) and Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD).\n\nAt the Data for Development Festival in Bristol in March 2017, the Collaborative agreed to produce guidance on data interoperability for development practitioners. This resulted in the launching in October 2018, at the second UN World Data Forum taking place in Dubai, of the first version of a document entitled \"Data interoperability: A practitioner's guide to joining up data in the development sector\". \n\nThe Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability will continue to build and maintain the Guide in this electronic space as it develops as a tool, adding new modules and examples as well as ancillary materials to help raise awareness of its existence and usability.\n\nIt is hoped that new synergies will form between data producers, publishers, users, and those providing capacity building and training. In this way, the guidance set out within the Guide can be incorporated into existing training materials and modules, and a consistent approach to the system-wide improvement of data interoperability can start to become a reality in the development sector.\n\n\n\n"

Research done in part with collaboration from Brooklyn Public Library found that frontline library staff required training and ongoing support to better respond to patron needs regarding digital privacy or data profiling issues.1 The Data Privacy Project aims to meet that need. With additional training and easy step- by-step resource guides and straightforward training materials, we believe that libraries will be more likely to live up to their professional commitment to protecting patron privacy.\n\n    As the Internet and its usage continue to influence and shape our lives, the issues of digital privacy and data profiling are central to policymaking and public debate. The extent of government surveillance programs, differential treatment of online consumers, and the need for protection of sensitive personal data have increased the urgency of addressing these matters.\n\n\n\n"

The Act is  a  reasonably  short  document  which  clearly  spells  out  right  from  the  start  what  a  person’s data protection rights are.The  new  dual  laws  of  the  GDPR  and  the  DP  Bill  are  welcome  in  that  they  expand  and  clarify  data protection for the 21stCentury, but  by introducing two separate pieces  of law there  is the opportunity for confusion for the public to know what their rights are, when they can be used and how. This briefing outlines the difference between the GDPR and the DP Bill and outlines the welcome aspects of the DP Bill for the public and areas of concern which Parliament should look to query and address.

According  to  the  Information  Commissioner’s  Office,  in  the financial year ending 31stMarch2011, there were 165 data breaches, only 1 per cent lower than the previous year’s record highof  167.1Despite  these  figures,  the  number  of  NHS employees with access to privaterecords appears to havesteadily increased in recent years.  Last  year,  Big Brother  Watch  reported  that  at  least  101,272  non-medical  personnel  had access to confidential medical records on file in the NHS.2Securing  patient  information  should  be  a  core  priority  for  the  NHS  and  as  this  research shows, not enough is being done to ensure patients’ privacy is protected.  This  problem  has  been  recognised  at  the  highest  levels.  Speaking  at  the  10th  annual  data protection   compliance   conference   in   London,   Information   Commissioner   Christopher Graham  said  data  breaches  in  the  NHS  continue  to  be  \"a  major  problem\".  Of  the  47 undertakings the ICO has agreed with organisations that have breached the Data Protection Act since April, over 40 percent (19) were in the healthcare sector.\n\n\n\n"

Big data collected from social media can provide real-time awareness about political protests. Yet practitioners, researchers, and policymakers face unique challenges and opportunities when assessing technological benefit, risk, and harm. How can these technologies be used responsibly to assist those in need, prevent abuse, and protect people from harm?”\n\nMark Latonero and Zachary Gold address the issues in this primer for technologists, academics, business, governments, NGOs, intergovernmental organizations — anyone interested in the future of human rights and human security in a data-saturated world.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "This paper proposes a new class of data called decentralized autonomic data (DAD). The term decentralizedmeans that the governance of the data may not reside with a single party. A related concept is that the trust in the data provenance is difuse in nature. Central to the approach is leveraging the emerging DID (decentralized identifer) standard. The term autonomic means self-managing or self-regulating. In the context of data, we crystalize the meaning of self-managing to include cryptographic techniques for maintaining data provenance that make the data self-identifying, self-certifying, and self-securing. Implied thereby is the use of cryptographic keys and signatures to provide a root of trust for data integrity and to maintain that trust over transformation of that data, e.g. provenance. Thus key management must be a frst order property of DADs. This includes key reproduction, rotation, and recovery. The pre-rotation and hybrid recovery methods presented herein are somewhat novel.\n\n\n\n"

Email addresses, usernames, and website domains are borrowed or \"rented\" through DNS, X.509, and social networks. This results in severe usability and security challenges Internet-wide. This paper describes a possible alternate approach called decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI), which returns control of online identities to the entities they belong to. By doing so, DPKI addresses many usability and security challenges that plague traditional public key infrastructure (PKI). DPKI has advantages at each stage of the PKI life cycle. It makes permissionless bootstrapping of online identities possible and provides for the simple creation of stronger SSL certificates. In usage, it can help “Johnny” to finally encrypt thanks to its relegation of public key management to secure decentralized datastores. Finally, it includes mechanisms to recover lost or compromised identifiers.\n\n\n\n"

A “deepfake” is a video that has been altered through some form of machine learning to “hybridize or generate human bodies and faces,” whereas a “cheap fake” is an AV manipulation created with cheaper, more accessible software (or, none at all). Cheap fakes can be rendered through Photoshop, lookalikes, re-contextualizing footage, speeding, or slowing.\n\nThanks to social media, both kinds of AV manipulation can now be spread at unprecedented speeds.

In this paper, we provide requirements for digital credential wallet design, ofer considerations for key management of DCWs, and go over several real-life use cases.INTRODUCTIONDigital credentials are seeing widespread usage as governments, businesses, and individuals increasingly come online. Users need to be able to store these credentials for ease of use. Moreover, others validating these credentials need to be able to do so in a secure manner. In order to do this, digital credentials are stored in what are called DigitalCredentialWallets (DCW).The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the considerations needed to build digital credential wallets and various use cases to put these considerations into perspective.\n\n\n\n"

This one example alone shows that ill-considered and poorly executed data sharing often makes the vulnerable even more so. It wasdetermined by the Supreme Court3earlier in the year that sharing personal information for the benefit of “wellbeing” failed to meet the high bar set by the Data Protection Act which says data use must be “vital”.\n\n\n\n"

The 18th century enlightenment period gave birth to a self-conscious sense of power and responsibility among people in Europe – together with a few important links to Ben Franklin’s United States – and this proved to be one of the major revolutionary events of the modern era. It can be argued that the World Wide Web, emblematic of our Digital era, embodies the basic Enlightenment ideals of Diderot’s original emblem. At this moment, two decades after the emergence of the Web, we can see changes in our social lives that were impossible to foresee 20 years ago. We have practically unlimited access to information, new attractive ways of social communication and a wealth of new services. But on the downside we see worries about security, privacy and access.\n\n\n\n"

Our digital footprints can reveal where we have been and when, who we have spoken to, the  content  of  our  private  conversations  and,  via  our  internet  history,  even  some  of  our  innermost thoughts.More  and  more,  such  data  is  being  sought  in  criminal  investigations.  Clearly,  data  from  devices can be highly relevant to investigations, particularly if the offence involves digital communications. But our research has revealed that police are seeking masses of personal data by default that is not relevant to an investigation at all, and may not be lawful.The  scale  and  depth  of  the  police’s  mobile  phone  searches  are  incomparable  with  the  police’s  legislative  powers  to  carry  out  physical  searches.  It  would  amount  to  police  searching someone’s property and taking copies of all photographs, documents, letters, films, albums, books and files.These  would  be  intrusive  searches  even  for  most  suspects  of  crime.  But  now,  police  are  carrying out these intrusive digital searches against victims of crime.\n\n\n\n"

It allows cross-border authentication, in a secure, reliable and trusted way, by making national electronic identification systems interoperable.\nOnce this building block is deployed in a Member State, the mutual recognition of national eIDs becomes possible between participating Member States, in line with the eIDAS (electronic Identification and Signature) legal framework (see eIDAS Regulation (EU) 910/2014 ) and with the privacy requirements of all the participating countries. Mutual recognition of national eIDs allows citizens of one Member State to access online services provided by public and private organisations from other participating EU Member States, using their own national eID.\n\n Following the successful completion of the STORK pilot programme (as described in section 2 of this document), CEF has taken on the role to 'productise' and support roll-out of eID connectivity to other Member States. This has included the development of open-source software components, documentation, training and support. Member States can leverage their electronic ID systems to provide access to the services of other Member States with confidence in the levels of assurance provided by secure means of authentication linked to qualified identities.\n\nThe technical management of the eID building block DSI is done by the Directorate-General for Informatics (DIGIT ) of the European Commission.\nImplementation of the EU policy directly related to eID and Trust Services is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CNECT ) of the European Commission.\nThe Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA ) is responsible for the implementation of the CEF Telecom programme grants in cooperation with the Commission.\n\n\n\n"

In this report we suggest that they are two sides of the same problem: issues of discrimination in the workforce and in system building are deeply related. Moreover: tackling the challenges of bias within technical systems requires addressing workforce diversity: and vice versa. Our research points to new ways of understanding the relationships between these complex problems: which can open up new pathways to redressing the current imbalances and harms.\nDrawing on a thorough review of existing literature and current research working on issues of gender: race: class: and artificial intelligence: this pilot study examines the scale of AI’s current diversity crisis and possible paths forward. It represents the first stage of a multi-year project examining the intersection of gender: race and power in AI.\n\n\n\n"

The overwhelming majority of police forces are unable to distinguish the profiles of those convicted to those not charged, let alone found innocent. There is little to no standardisation between forces. Because of this, our research suggests the costof implementing the Protectionof Freedoms Actwill be double the Government’s own estimate, also casting serious doubt on the accuracy of the on-goingcosts of implementation. Whilstmaking good progress, the Protection of Freedoms Actdoes not fulfil the Coalition agreement’s pledge toimplement the Scottish model,with a broad discretionary power to retain DNA for ‘national security’purposes that was highlighted by the Joint Committee on Human Rights as a serious concern. Retention under this header will notbe authorised by judges. As recognised by the Information Commissioners Office, there remainsno provision for individuals to request the deletion of their DNA and fingerprints.  There is similarly no independent appeal process for those individuals whose DNA and fingerprints the Chief Officerhave refused to destroy.As the data sharing agenda continues apace, Britain continues to put its citizens ata disadvantage internationally by allowing these databases to remain substantially broader than other countries.\n\n\n\n"

Starting assumptions, actual data use practices, interpretation, context context context — all complicate the story around education data and must be kept in mind if equity is our objective.\n\n\n\n"

The best interests of some individuals are optimized at the expense of the society. Accountability programs, particularly when coupled with school choice models, serve to keep middle and upper middle class families invested in public schools, but in an uneven and patterned way, causing segregated school environments to persist despite racial and socioeconomic residential diversity.\n\n\n\n"

Only by providing certainty on the legal validity of all these services, businesses and citizens will use the digital interactions as their natural way of interaction.\n\nWith eIDAS, the EU has managed to lay down the right foundations and a predictable legal framework for people, companies (in particular SMEs) and public administrations to safely access to services and do transactions online and across border in just \"one click\". Indeed, rolling out eIDAS means higher security and more convenience for any online activity such submitting tax declarations, enrolling in a foreign university, remotely opening a bank account, setting up a business in another Member State, authenticating for internet payments, bidding to on line call for tender, etc.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "eInvoicing represents a clear example of how digital innovation can provide efficiencies and cost-cutting measures of tangible benefit to public administrations, citizens and businesses throughout Europe. Since 2001, European legislation has given electronic invoices legal equivalence with their paper counterparts.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the proliferation of eInvoicing standards and syntaxes coexisting in the Member States led to increased complexity in term of cross-border interoperability. Additionally, the take-up of electronic invoices in public administrations is still rather low despite the many benefits offered (savings, simplification, etc.).\n\nAs a consequence, the European Parliament and Council voted on the 16th of April 2014 Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement. The Directive calls for the definition of a common European standard at semantic level and additional standardisation deliverables which will enhance interoperability at the syntax level.\n\nAdditionally, it will become mandatory for all contracting authorities and contracting entities to receive and process eInvoices complying with the European standard, starting in November 2018.\n\nThe definition of the eInvoicing European standard will be carried out by CEN , a European Standardisation Organisation; CEN will use the work of existing standardisation initiatives such as CEN BII workshops agreement or “European Multi-stakeholder Forum on eInvoicing” recommendations as a baseline.\n\nThe European Commission shall assist CEN in the European standard definition, and provide guidance to Member States in the implementation of the Directive. These actions will be funded by the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) through a work programme of € 9 million over 4 years.\n\nThis action will be undertaken by the eInvoicing building block Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI).\n\nThe purpose of the eInvoicing building block is to promote the uptake and accelerate the use of eInvoicing respecting the European standard, amongst both public and private entities established in the EU, as well as in participating EEA countries.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to provide a general introduction to the eInvoicing building block of CEF Telecom.\n\nThe CEF building blocks are reusable specifications, software and services that will form part of a wide variety of IT systems in different policy domains of the EU.\nThe promotion of common building blocks is a way to lower barriers for technical integration and provide tried and tested solutions that will speed up the delivery of Digital Public Services in a cost efficient manner.\n\nThe technical management of the eInvoicing DSI is carried out by the Directorate-General for Informatics (DIGIT ) of the European Commission.\n\nImplementation of the EU policy directly related to eInvoicing is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROWTH ) of the European Commission.\n\nThe Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA ) is responsible for the implementation of the CEF Telecom programme grants in cooperation with the Commission.\nThe CEF building blocks are coordinated and managed by the Directorate- General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CNECT r ) of the European Commission.\n\n\n\n"

The data that we store is often not protected in an appropriatemanner.Legislation, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), incentivizes service providers to better preserve individuals' privacy, primarily through making the providers liable in the event of a data breach. This liability pressure has revealed a technological gap, whereby providers are often not equipped with technology that can suitably protect their customers. Encrypted Data Vaults fll this gap and provide a variety of other benefts.This paper describes current approaches and architectures, derived requirements, design goals, and dangers that implementers should be aware of when implementing data storage. This paper also explores the base assumptions of these sorts of systems such as providing privacy-respecting mechanisms for storing, indexing, and retrieving encrypted data, as well as data portability.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Privacy is a growing concern in the United States and around the world. The spread of the Internet and the seemingly boundaryless options for collecting, saving, sharing, and comparing information trigger consumer worries. Online practices of business and government agencies may present new ways to compromise privacy, and e-commerce and technologies that make a wide range of personal information available to anyone with a Web browser only begin to hint at the possibilities for inappropriate or unwarranted intrusion into our personal lives. Engaging Privacy and Information Technology in a Digital Age presents a comprehensive and multidisciplinary examination of privacy in the information age. It explores such important concepts as how the threats to privacy evolving, how can privacy be protected and how society can balance the interests of individuals, businesses and government in ways that promote privacy reasonably and effectively? This book seeks to raise awareness of the web of connectedness among the actions one takes and the privacy policies that are enacted, and provides a variety of tools and concepts with which debates over privacy can be more fruitfully engaged. Engaging Privacy and Information Technology in a Digital Age focuses on three major components affecting notions, perceptions, and expectations of privacy: technological change, societal shifts, and circumstantial discontinuities. This book will be of special interest to anyone interested in understanding why privacy issues are often so intractable.\n\n\n\n"

The W3C Credentials Community Group focuses on how privacy can be enhanced when attributes are shared electronically. In the course of our work, we have identified three related but distinct privacy enhancing strategies: \"data minimization,\" \"selective disclosure,\" and \"progressivetrust.\" These enhancements are enabled with cryptography. The goal of this paper is to enable decision makers, particularly non-technical ones, to gain a nuanced grasp of these enhancements along with some idea of how their enablers work. We describe them below in plain English, but with some rigor. This knowledge will enable readers of this paper to be better able to know when they need privacy enhancements, to select the type of enhancement needed, to assess techniques that enable those enhancements, and to adopt the correct enhancement for the correct use case.\n\n\n\n"

Specifically they highlighted the powers of entry that were available to organisations such as Inland Revenue. More recently, Lord  Selsdon  and  Lord  Marlesford  have  both  attempted  to  legislate  for  greater restrictions on their use. Prior  to  the  election, the  Conservatives pledgedto  curb  the  disproportionate number  of these  powers.In  their  manifesto  they promisedto cut back “intrusive powers  of  entry.”2However,almost  four  years  later,there  remain  more  than  1,000 powers  that  allow  public  officials  to  enter  private property.

It also guarantees rights for subscribers when they use these services. These are the main requirements imposed by the Directive:\n\n1) Confidentiality of communications: EU Member States must ensure the confidentiality of communications over public networks, in particular by prohibiting the listening into, tapping and storage of communications without the consent of the users concerned.\n2) Security of networks and services: a provider of a public electronic communications service has to take appropriate measures to safeguard the security of its service.\n3) Data breach notifications: if a provider suffers a breach of security that leads to personal data being lost or stolen, it has to inform the national authority and, in certain cases, the subscriber or individual.\n4) Traffic and location data: this data must be erased or made anonymous when no longer required for communication or billing purposes, except if the subscriber has given consent for another use.\n5) Spam: subscribers must give their prior consent before unsolicited commercial communications (\"spam\") are addressed to them. This also covers SMS text messages and other electronic messages received on any fixed or mobile terminal.\n6) Public directories: subscribers' prior consent is required in order for their telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and postal addresses to appear in public directories.\n7) Calling-line identification: subscribers must be given the option not to have their telephone number disclosed when they make a call.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "As more organizations and individuals move on-line, concerns for privacy and security of personal information grow and new trade-offs arise. \nIs there a combination of economic incentives and technological solutions to privacy issues that is acceptable for the individual and beneficial to society? Is there a “sweet spot” that satisfies the interests of all parties? \nThis dissertation combines technological and economic analysis to answer these questions. It introduces some of the most challenging technological and economic issues in the debate on privacy of personal information. It proposes cryptographic protocols to protect the privacy and anonymity of individuals in environments such as elections, payments, and recommendation systems. It then highlights novel economic aspects of the use of tracking and privacy-enhancing technologies. \nOn the technological side, the dissertation presents a novel method to protect the privacy of individuals through the coordination among parties that do not know each other. In this method, privacy is protected through anonymity, by hiding the identity of an individual completing a certain transaction amidst the identities of many other individuals completing similar transactions. These transactions are completed through a third party that does not need to be trusted. While several applications of this method are possible, this dissertation discusses its embodiment as an anonymous payment system and as an electronic voting and recommendation system. As a payment system, the method allows anonymous payments to be completed while guaranteeing the atomicity of the transaction. As a voting system, the method allows write-in ballots to be receipt-free and universally verifiable.\n\n\n\n"

Personal data is not solely about technology as it encompasses also legal, design, social and economic issues. At the same time, in a technological world, technological standards are key as they shape actual practices, so there is a need to ensure that the values we want to prevail in our society are well embedded in the technologies we create and use every day. We want a responsible and ethical digital society that benefits people, businesses and society. \n\nA fair and efficient digital society requires personal data to flow freely under the strict control of individuals themselves. It is perfectly aligned with the EU Digital Single Market strategy. As the importance of personal data in society continues to expand, it becomes increasingly urgent to make sure individuals are in a position to control their personal data, but also to gain personal knowledge from them and to claim their share of benefits. Healthcare, smart cities, environmental protection count among the many examples of tomorrow’s challenges requiring an optimal circulation of data between organizations and, at the same time, a use that is well understood, accepted and most of all put under the control of individuals.\n\n\n\n"

He argues that information algorithms like the ones used to identify “trends” on Facebook do not work alone and cannot work alone and argues that “in so many ways that we must simply discard the fantasy that they do, or ever will.”\n\n    People are in the algorithm because how could they not be? People produce the Facebook activity being measured, people design the algorithms and set their evaluative criteria, people decide what counts as a trend, people name and summarize them, and people look to game the algorithm with their next posts.\n\n    Trending algorithms are undeniably becoming part of the cultural landscape, and revelations like Gizmodo’s are helpful steps in helping us shed the easy notions of what they are and how they work, notions the platforms have fostered. Social media platforms must come to fully realize that they are newsmakers and gatekeepers, whether they intend to be or not, whether they want to be or not. And while algorithms can chew on a lot of data, it is still a substantial, significant, and human process to turn that data into claims about importance that get fed back to millions of users. This is not a realization that they will ever reach on their own — which suggests to me that they need the two countervailing forces that journalism has: a structural commitment to the public, imposed if not inherent, and competition to force them to take such obligations seriously.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Facial recognition has long been feared as a feature of a future authoritarian society, with its potential to turn CCTV cameras into identity checkpoints, creating a world where citizens are intensively watched and tracked.However,  facial  recognition  is  now  a  reality  in  the  UK  –  despite  the  lack  of  any  legal  basis  or  parliamentary  scrutiny,  and  despite  the  significant  concerns  raised  by  rights  and  race  equality  groups.  This  new  technology  poses  an  unprecedented  threat  to  citizens’  privacy  and  civil  liberties,  and  could fundamentally undermine the rights we enjoy in public spaces.Police forces in the UK have rolled out automatic facial recognition at a pace unlike any other democratic nation in the world. Leicestershire Police, South Wales Police and the Metropolitan Police have deployed this technology at shopping centres, festivals, sports events, concerts, community events – and even a peaceful demonstration. One police force even used the surveillance tool to keep innocent people with mental health issues away from a public event. In this report, we explain how facial recognition technology works, how it is being used by police in the UK, and how it risks reshaping our rights.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "In this briefing, we examine one of the most pressing issues in the area of civil liberties andbiometrics in the UK - police forces’ use of live facial recognition surveillance technology. Wewelcome   the   opportunity   to   provide   briefing   ahead   of   this   debate   and   seek   to   informparliamentarians of the significant risks live facial recognition surveillance poses to humanrights and the rule of law in the UK.A   threat   to   freedom:   The   emergence   of   live   facial   recognition   surveillance   bypolice   in   England   and   Wales   poses  one   of   the   most   serious   threats   to   civilliberties   of   recent   years.   This   China-style   mass   surveillance   tool   risks   turningCCTV cameras into biometric checkpoints and citizens into walking ID cards.Incompatible with human rights: We explore the impact of live facial recognitionsurveillance   on   human   rights   in   the   UK   and   explain   why   such   biometriccheckpoints cannot be compatible with the rights framework.Discriminatory:  Furthermore, research has found that many live facial recognitionalgorithms   have   discriminatory   effect,   disproportionately   misidentifyingblack people and women.No law, policy or safeguards: Parliament has never passed a law enabling policeuse   of   facial   recognition   surveillance.   There   are   no   laws   and   no   safeguardsregulating this alarming expansion of surveillance in the UK. Ineffective:    Over   recent   years,   live   facial   recognition   has   proven   to   bedangerously   inaccurate,   producing   high   numbers   of   ‘false   positive’   matches.Police   have   accrued  thousands   of   false   positive   matches  of   members   of   thepublic whose photos have been subsequently taken and, for a period, stored.Over-policing:   Big   Brother   Watch   has   witnessed  innocent   members   of   thepublic   being   misidentified,   stopped   and   searched   –  including   a   14  year   oldblack boy in school uniform. We have also witnessed people being stopped andforced   to   show   identification, and in one case even  fined, for wearing hoodedjackets or having scarves covering their chins in winter weather. Secondly,   we   raise   the   issue   that  the   custody   image   database   contains   hundreds   ofthousands of innocent people’s images, likely unlawfully.\n\n\n\n"

We call   on the Scottish Parliament  to clarify the legal basis for thepolice’s taking and retention of images. We recommend that any Police Scotland or other public body’s use of post-eventfacial recognition analysis must be provided for by law, with proper statutorysafeguards and guidance including independent authorisation, a requirementfor any use to be proportionate and limited to a specific time period and athreshold for strict necessity with no other less intrusive means practicable.We call on Police Scotland to not use live facial recognition surveillance in publicplaces.\n\n\n\n"

We outline this mismatch with five “traps” that fair-ML work can fall into even as it attempts to be more context-aware in comparison to traditional data science. We draw on studies of sociotechnical systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such traps occur and how to avoid them. Finally, we suggest ways in which technical designers can mitigate the traps through a refocusing of design in terms of process rather than solutions, and by drawing abstraction boundaries to include social actors rather than purely technical ones.”\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "The Reform consists of two instruments:\n* The General Data Protection Regulation will enable people to better control their personal data. At the same time modernised and unified rules will allow businesses to make the most of the opportunities of the Digital Single Market by cutting red tape and benefiting from reinforced consumer trust.\n* The Data Protection Directive for the police and criminal justice sector will ensure that the data of victims, witnesses, and suspects of crimes, are duly protected in the context of a criminal investigation or a law enforcement action. At the same time more harmonised laws will also facilitate cross-border cooperation of police or prosecutors to combat crime and terrorism more effectively across Europe. \n\nA fundamental right for citizens\nThe reform will allow people to regain control of their personal data. Two-thirds of Europeans (67%), according to a recent Eurobarometer survey, stated they are concerned about not having complete control over the information they provide online. Seven Europeans out of ten worry about the potential use that companies may make of the information disclosed. The data protection reform will strengthen the right to data protection, which is a fundamental right in the EU, and allow them to have trust when they give their personal data.\n\nThe new rules address these concerns by strengthening the existing rights and empowering individuals with more control over their personal data. Most notably, these include:\n* easier access to your own data: individuals will have more information on how their data is processed and this information should be available in a clear and understandable way;\n* a right to data portability: it will be easier to transfer your personal data between service providers;\n* aclarified \"right to be forgotten\": when you no longer want your data to be processed, and provided that there are no legitimate grounds for retaining it, the data will be deleted;\n* the right to know when your data has been hacked: For example, companies and organisations must notify the national supervisory authority of serious data breaches as soon as possible so that users can take appropriate measures. \n\nClear modern rules for businesses\nIn today's digital economy, personal data has acquired enormous economic significance, in particular in the area of big data. By unifying Europe's rules on data protection, lawmakers are creating a business opportunity and encouraging innovation.\n* One continent, one law: The regulation will establish one single set of rules which will make it simpler and cheaper for companies to do business in the EU.\n* One-stop-shop: businesses will only have to deal with one single supervisory authority. This is estimated to save €2.3 billion per year.\n* European rules on European soil– companies based outside of Europe will have to apply the same rules when offering services in the EU.\n* Risk-based approach: the rules will avoid a burdensome one-size-fits-all obligation and rather tailor them to the respective risks.\n* Rules fit for innovation: the regulation will guarantee that data protection safeguards are built into products and services from the earliest stage of development (Data protection by design). Privacy-friendly techniques such as pseudonomysation will be encouraged, to reap the benefits of big data innovation while protecting privacy. \n\nBenefits for big and small alike\nThe data protection reform will stimulate economic growth by cutting costs and red tape for European business, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The EU's data protection reform will help SMEs break into new markets. Under the new rules, SMEs will benefit from four reductions in red tape:\n* No more notifications: Notifications to supervisory authorities are a formality that represents a cost for business of €130 million every year. The reform will scrap these entirely.\n* Every penny counts: Where requests to access data are manifestly unfounded or excessive, SMEs will be able to charge a fee for providing access.\n* Data Protection Officers: SMEs are exempt from the obligation to appoint a data protection officer insofar as data processing is not their core business activity.\n* Impact Assessments: SMEs will have no obligation to carry out an impact assessment unless there is a high risk. \n\nProtecting personal data in the area of law enforcement\n* Better cooperation between law enforcement authorities\nWith the new Data Protection Directive for Police and Criminal Justice Authorities, law enforcement authorities in EU Member States will be able to exchange information necessary for investigations more efficiently and effectively, improving cooperation in the fight against terrorism and other serious crime in Europe.\nThe Data Protection Directive for Police and Criminal Justice Authorities takes account of the specific needs of law enforcement, respects the different legal traditions in Member States and is fully in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  \nBetter protection of citizens 'data\nIndividuals' personal data will be better protected, whenprocessed for any law enforcement purpose including prevention of crime. It will protect everyone – regardless of whether they are a victim, criminal or witness. All law enforcement processing in the Union must comply with the principles of necessity, proportionality and legality, with appropriate safeguards for the individuals. Supervision is ensured by independent national data protection authorities, and effective judicial remedies must be provided.\nThe Data Protection Directive for Police and Criminal Justice Authorities provides clear rules for the transfer of personal data by law enforcement authorities outside the EU, to ensure that the level of protection of individuals guaranteed in the EU is not undermined. \n\nNext steps\nFollowing political agreement reached in trilogue, the final texts will be formally adopted by the European Parliament and Council at the beginning 2016. The new rules will become applicable two years thereafter.\nThe Commission will work closely with Member State Data protection authorities to ensure a uniform application of the new rules. During the two-year transition phase, the Commission will inform citizens about their rights and companies about their obligations.\nData Protection Authorities will work more closely together in the future, especially through the one-stop shop mechanism to solve cross-border data protection cases. \n\nBackground\nThe Data protection package is a key enabler of the Digital Single Market and the EU Agenda on Security.\nProposed by then EU Justice Commissioner, Vice-President Viviane Reding in January 2012 (see IP/12/46), the data protection reform package includes the General Data Protection Regulation and the data Protection Directive for Police and Criminal Justice Authorities. It updates and replaces the current Data protection rules that are based on the 1995 Data Protection Directive and the 2008 Framework Decision for the police and criminal justice sector.\n\n\n\n"

You can read the full research below.\n\nThe widespread support for EU regulators to do more to ensure Google complies with existing privacy regulations highlights how people want to see real, concrete action taken to protect their privacy.\n\n\n\n"

However, physical cash is vulnerable to rising threats - such as large scale, government-mandated forgeries - that digital cash may protect against more effectively. We study mechanisms to combine physical cash with digital cash to remove their respective shortcomings and obtain their combined advantages. We discuss initial mechanisms, ranging from cryptographic signatures embedded in 2-D barcodes, to physical one-way functions coupled with online verification systems, and examine their cost and benefit trade-offs.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "The initial years of transition in the Russian federation have been characterised by relatively smaller falls in employment than observed in other reform-orientated countries of Eastern Europe. We show that for many Russian workers, the dominant form of labour market adjustment is instead the delayed receipt of wages. There are large regional variations in the incidence of wage arrears. Workers in the metropolitan centre are significantly less affected by delayed and incomplete wage payments than workers in the provinces. There is less evidence that individual characteristics contribute much toward the incidence of wage arrears, though unobserved heterogeneity has some role to play. Wage arrears are found across the skill distribution. As with the incidence of unemployment, however, there is evidence that the persistence of arrears is concentrated on a subset of the working population. We show that workers can only exercise the exit option of a job quit from a firm paying wages in arrears if the outside labour market is sufficiently dynamic.\n\n\n\n"

In   other   words, a   DPIA   is   a   process   for   building   and demonstrating compliance.Under  the  GDPR, non-compliance  with  DPIA  requirements  can  lead  to  fines  imposed  by  the competent supervisory authority.Failure to carry out a DPIA when the processing is subject to a DPIA(Article 35(1) and (3)-(4)), carrying out a DPIA in an incorrect way(Article 35(2) and (7) to (9)), or failing to consult the competent supervisory authority where required(Article 36(3)(e)),can result in an  administrativefine of up  to  10M€,  or  in  the  case  of  an  undertaking,  up  to  2  %  of  the  total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "The General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’),1due to come into effect on 25 May 2018, providesa  modernised,  accountability-based  compliance  framework  for  data  protection  in  Europe.Data Protection Officers(‘DPO’s) will be at the heart of this new legal frameworkfor many organisations, facilitatingcompliance with the provisions of the GDPR.Under the GDPR, it ismandatory for certain controllers and processors to designate a DPO.2This will be the casefor all public authorities and bodies(irrespective of what data they process), andfor other organisations that-as a core activity -monitor individuals systematically and on a large scale, orthatprocess special categories of personal data on a large scale. Even  when  the GDPR  does  not  specifically  require  the appointment  of  a  DPO,  organisations may sometimes  find  it  useful  to  designate  a  DPO  on  a  voluntary  basis.  The Article  29  Data  Protection Working Party (‘WP29’) encourages these voluntary efforts.The  concept  of  DPO  is  not  new.  Although  Directive  95/46/EC3did  not  require any organisation  to appoint a DPO, the practice of appointing a DPO has nevertheless developed in several Member States over the years.Before  the  adoption  of  the  GDPR,  the WP29 argued that  the  DPO  is  a  cornerstone  of  accountability and that appointing a DPO can facilitate compliance and furthermore,become a competitive advantage for  businesses.4In  addition  to facilitating  compliance  through  theimplementation  of  accountability tools (such asfacilitating  data  protection  impact  assessmentsand carrying  out  or  facilitating audits),DPOsact as intermediariesbetween relevant stakeholders (e.g. supervisory authorities, data subjects, and businessunits within an organisation). DPOs are not personally responsible in case of non-compliance with the GDPR. The GDPR makes it clear that itis the controller or the processor who is required to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that the processing  is  performed  in  accordance  with its  provisions (Article  24(1)).  Data  protection compliance is a responsibility of the controller or the processor.\n\n\n\n"

Cryptographic hashes, such as SHA-256, are often used to determine if published data has changed in unexpected ways. Due to the nature of most hyperlinks, the cryptographic hash is often published separately from the link itself.\n\nThis specification describes a data model and serialization formats for expressing cryptographically protected hyperlinks. The mechanisms described in the document enables a system to publish a hyperlink in a way that empowers a consuming application to determine if the resource associated with the hyperlink has changed in unexpected ways.\n\nWhile mechanisms such as RFC6920, Resource Integrity Proofs and Magnet Links exist, they have a number of shortcomings such as implementation complexity, a focus on narrow use cases, and no clear extensibility or upgrade path.\n\nThis specification attempts to preserve the good parts of RFC6920, standardize the good parts of Magnet Links and Resource Integrity Proofs while ensuring that implementation complexity is kept to a minimum.\n\nYou can view an HTML version of the specification here:\n\nhttps://w3c-dvcg.github.io/hashlink/\n\nWe encourage contributions meeting the Contribution Guidelines.

The length of these policiesand their often convoluted language have been shown to discourage most users fromreading them.  Recent progress in natural language processing and machine learninghas opened the door to the development of technologies that are capable of automati-cally extracting statements (or “annotations”) from the text of privacy policies.  Thesetechnologies could help users quickly identify those elements of a privacy notice theycare about - without requiring them to read the full text of the notice.In  this  article,  we  review  the  requirements  associated  with  the  development  ofQuery Answering functionality that would enable users to ask questions about spe-cific aspects of privacy notices (e.g. Does this app share my location with third parties?Am I able to review the information this website collects about me?  Can I delete myaccount?   For how long is my information going to be retained by this company?).We  discuss  different  possible  approaches  to  supporting  such  functionality  and  howthey relate to recent advances in automatically annotating privacy notices.  Initial re-sults obtained with different machine learning/natural language processing techniquesare presented, suggesting that Query Answering functionality could be a particularlypromising approach to informing users about privacy practices.  In particular, in con-trast to automated annotation techniques that aim to extract detailed statements fromthe text of privacy notices, Query Answering functionality could be configured to re-turn short text fragments extracted from privacy notices and rely on the user (ratherthan the computer) to interpret some of the finer nuances of the text found in thesefragments. Such an approach could potentially prove more robust than fully automatedannotation techniques,  which at least at this time struggle with the interpretation offiner nuances.\n\n\n\n"

Much of the contributions of research to practice are invisible, especially when they are successful. There are no signposts to flag how early education becomes a priority, or a school starts serving breakfast, or why early-career teachers are paired with veteran mentors. But if there were, the signs might say say this is brought to you by research from xyz, or student data from over 100,000 kids in 45 school districts over a 5-year period have informed this new practice.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) community has described several groundbreaking properties that arise from the adoption of its principles. Governance, as in business and fnancing structure, is arguably the most challenging of these properties, captured succinctly by Shoshana Zubof as: \"Who decides? Who decides who decides?\" However,even though the technology has matured greatly over recent years, bootstrapping an SSI product within the existing capitalistic market environment is complicated and has not been achieved at scale within any functional domain.A RWOT6 paper explored the challenges to a sustainable commons. In this paper, we apply the SWOT framework (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) to identify potential paths to adoption. For example, what are the general implications of introducing a credential holder into existing issuer/verifer relationships? Our analysis leads to cooperative (in the legal sense) governance with focus on the holder (the wallet) as the key innovation, since issuers and verifers already exist. The healthcare industry is used as an example.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "One of the major problems with bootstrapping self-sovereign identity is that it requires adoption by a large number of people. Pushing self-sovereign identity from the top-down is most likely to result in a technology that’s not actually used, but instead encouraging the average person to demand self-sovereign identity from the bottom-up will result in the organic development of a vibrant, well-utilized decentralized web-of-trust ecosystem.This paper addresses that need by ofering arguments to a variety of people who might be reluctant to use self-sovereign identity, uninterested in its possibilities, or oblivious to the dangers of centralization. By focusing on theneeds of real people, we hope to also encourage developers, engineers, and software business owners to create the apps that will address their reluctance and fulfll their needs, making self-sovereign identity a reality\n\n\n\n"

Other volumes in this series specify the Forth and C language programming interfaces, as well as the EMV application library and the Terminal Kernal Test Program (see related publications).\nThe overall architecture of the Open Terminal Architecture is described in Appendix F, “System Architecture,” and is based on a Virtual Machine (VM) that can be programmed using high-level languages such as Forth or C. For compactness and efficiency a tokenised form has been developed for delivering compiled programs to terminals of all CPU types. This and other Virtual Machine related issues are explained in Section 3.\nThis International Standard describes a set of functions to be implemented in terminals in terms of instructions for a Virtual Machine. With these functions the application programmer is able to generate application software that is compact, portable and certifiable on all OTA terminals.\n\n\n\n"

Infor-mation  privacy  revolves  around  the  fun-damental  principle  ofnotice  and  choice,namely the idea that users should be ableto  make  informed  decisions  about  whatinformation  about  them  can  be  collectedand  how  it  can  be  used.    Internet  userswant  control  over  their  privacy,  but  theirchoices are often hidden in long and con-voluted privacy policy documents.  More-over,  little  (if  any)  prior  work  has  beendone  to  detect  the  provision  of  choicesin text.  We address this challenge of en-abling user choice by automatically iden-tifying and extracting pertinent choice lan-guage in privacy policies. In particular, wepresent a two-stage architecture of classi-fication models to identify opt-out choicesin  privacy  policy  text,  labelling  commonvarieties of choices with a mean F1 scoreof 0.735.  Our techniques enable the cre-ation of systems to help Internet users tolearn about their choices, thereby effectu-ating notice and choice and improving In-ternet privacy.\n\n\n\n"

That    same    flexibility    and expressivity  also  makes  it  easy  to  misunderstand subtle nuances and often leads to ideological debate rather  than  understanding  and  applications.  We compensate  with adjectives, creating new phrases like “digital identity” or “legal identity”, but we often still  speak  past  each  other.  We  regularly  refer  to “identities” as things that are assigned to us or that we  own,  things  we  control  or  present,  instead  of using  more  rigorous  terms  such  as  “identifiers”  or “credentials”. This fluidity often confuses because, at its  core,  identity  is  an  emergent  phenomenon  that doesn’t   have   an   existence   independent   of   the observer.\n\n\n\n"

Given that identification and au- thentication systems constitute a large portion of the committee’s agenda, it is well positioned to comment on the technology and policy issues surrounding a nationwide identity system and its supporting infrastruc- tures (hereinafter referred to as a nationwide identity system). In fact, CSTB asked the committee to do so, in the interest of providing a timely contribution to the public debate. Additional resources from the Vadasz Family Foundation enabled development of this report.\nThe committee’s broader and more comprehensive final report is ex- pected in late 2002, but its members felt compelled to issue a brief report at this time because of the real possibility that further debate on a nation- wide identity system, and even action on the topic, could take place prior to the final report’s issuance. Thus the present effort outlines the issues the committee believes must be addressed and raises a number of ques- tions that the committee believes should be answered as part of any con- sideration of a nationwide identity system.\n\n\n\n"

At the sametime, individuals may not be aware of privacy choices thatare available to them. For instance, many privacy policiescontain links that allow users to opt out of certain data usepractices, such as the use or sharing of contact informa-tion for marketing purposes. We propose a method to makesuch privacy choices more salient to Internet users. Basedon an approach to automatically identify and classify opt-out choices in privacy policies, we designed a browser ex-tension that notifies users about available opt-out choiceson the websites they visit. The goal of our work is to notonly make users aware of available choices but also make iteasier for them to utilize those choices\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "This part of ISO/IEC 18013 establishes guidelines for the design format and data content of an ISO compliant driving licence (IDL) in regard to both visual human-readable features and ISO machine-readable technologies. It creates a common basis for international use and mutual recognition of the IDL without impeding individual national/community/regional motor vehicle authorities in taking care of their specific needs.\nThe design approach of the IDL ISO ID-1 size card and accompanying booklet with sleeve insert pocket is intended to replace the international driving permit (IDP) paper document (see annex G).\nThe basis of document design premises includes:\n* a minimum common mandatory data element set; \n* a common layout for ease of recognition; \n* minimum security requirements.\n\nAt the discretion of national/community/regional motor vehicle authorities, it\n* allows for inclusion of supplementary optional data elements to meet the needs of specific national/community/regional requirements apart from the minimum common mandatory data element set; \n* allows for the incorporation of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17 machine-readable technologies including magnetic stripe, integrated circuit with contacts, contactless integrated circuit and optical memory technology, and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC31 1-dimensional / 2-dimensional bar codes, at the option of national/community/regional authorities;\n* allows for the incorporation of current and future technologies (including biometrics, cryptography, data compression) at the option of national/community/regional authorities;\n* allows for additional document physical security elements at the option of national/community/regional authorities, and facilitates international procurements.\n\nA major benefit of these design premises is that a single card may serve a dual purpose of both a national/community/regional licence as well as an internationally recognized licence. Therefore, one card, in some cases, can replace the need for two documents. Alternatively, those countries that choose to maintain their individual domestic design can issue a second card with or without ISO machine-readable technologies to replace the current IDP paper document.\n\nThis new IDL design yields a document that:\n* is more secure from counterfeiting and alteration than the previous IDP document;\n* allows authorities to verify the authenticity of the document;\n* integrates the personal data into a secure ID-1 size medium;\n* allows a more reliable identification of the licence holder;\n* allows for machine-readable technologies;\n* facilitates information exchange and mutual recognition among motor vehicle authorities;\n* allows the domestic driving licence (DDL) that meets this Standard to serve simultaneously as an ISO compliant driving licence (IDL).\n\nISO/IEC 18013 establishes guidelines for the design format and data content of an ISO-compliant driving licence (IDL) with regard to human-readable features (ISO/IEC 18013-1), ISO machine-readable technologies (ISO/IEC 18013-2), and access control, authentication and integrity validation (ISO/IEC 18013-3). It creates a common basis for international use and mutual recognition of the IDL without impeding individual countries/states in applying their privacy rules and national/community/regional motor vehicle authorities in taking care of their specific needs.\nThe purpose of storing IDL data on machine-readable media on the IDL is to\n* increase productivity (of data and IDL use), \n* facilitate electronic data exchange,\n* assist in authenticity and integrity validation.\n\npart of ISO/IEC 18013 thus specifies the following: \n* mandatory and optional machine-readable data;\n* the logical data structure;\n* encoding rules for the machine-readable technologies currently supported.\n\nTo prevent unauthorised access to the data contained on a contactless integrated circuit (e.g. by eavesdropping), provision is made to protect the privacy of the licence holder via basic access protection [requiring a human- readable and/or machine-readable key/password on the IDL to access the data on the contactless integrated circuit (via protected-channel communication)]. The implementation details of this function however are defined in ISO/IEC 18013-3.\nProvision is made for issuing authorities to validate the authenticity and integrity of the mandatory and optional data. In addition, the option of protecting access to optional data (beyond basic access protection) is provided for. The exact mechanism used to achieve such protection (e.g. encryption and/or additional access control) is specified in ISO/IEC 18013-3.\n\nThis International Standard establishes guidelines for the design format and data content of an ISO compliant driving licence (IDL) with regard to Human-readable features (Part 1), Machine-readable technologies (Part 2), and Access control, authentication and integrity validation (Part 3). It creates a common basis for international use and mutual recognition of the IDL without impeding individual countries/states to apply their privacy rules and national/community/regional motor vehicle authorities in taking care of their specific needs.\nThis Part of ISO/IEC 18013:\n*  Is based on the machine-readable data content specified in ISO/IEC 18013-2.\n*  Specifies mechanisms and rules available to issuing authorities for:\n(a) Access control (i.e. limiting access to the machine readable data recorded on the IDL).\n(b) Document authentication (i.e. confirming that the document was issued by the claimed issuing authority). \n(c) Data integrity validation (i.e. confirming that the data was not changed since issuing).\n\nThis Part of ISO/IEC 18013 does not address issues related to the subsequent use of data obtained from the IDL, e.g. privacy issues.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Many people who use the web express concern about both the increasing amounts of their personal data being collected online and the terms to which they agree. The existing global infrastructure for managing data and terms relies heavily on the use of ‘notices’, and these come from the data collector, rather than from the individual. Notices are the legal regulatory mechanisms that refer to privacy policies and terms of service. This system of notices is unfit for use in the contemporary digital context. The notices are often unreadable, unclear, and not useful in practice. They provide limited guidance for people and few benefits to the companies and organisations who issue them. Open Notice is an effort that calls for an open, global, and public infrastructure for legally required, digitally necessary consent-based notices. The Open Notice effort seeks to foster collaboration among the various projects working on these problems around the world. This paper outlines a framework for greater multi- stakeholder collaboration between these projects, regulators, and governments, with the aim of creating an open and global notice infrastructure.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "\"Human capital,\" \"ideas\" and \"knowledge\" have been used as interchangeable, almost synonymous terms, representing knowledge-related factors in the neoclassical literature on growth. This paper emphasizes the differences between different forms of knowledge and tests the response of a standard neoclassical model to the treatment of each form as a distinct factor of production. One factor is knowledge in the form of an individual's human capital. It needs to allocate its time between production, accumulation and a non-productive activity (rest or leisure). The second factor represents knowledge incorporated into physical tools, external to those who produced it. This \"intelligent\" capital (traditional capital incorporating human capital) is used in production and accumulation and does not need leisure. A distinction based on the different time constraints of the two factors can produce, under the hypothesis of balanced growth paths, competition between them and force negative rates of accumulation for one of the two \"rival\" factors. Moreover, both the endogenous and the exogenous growth results can be achieved, depending on the preferences of the agents. In particular, a trade-off arises between the endogeneity of the choice of leisure and the endogeneity of growth under admissible (in the sense of King, Plosser, Rebelo 1988) utility functional forms.\n\n\n\n"

We define DID Auth as a ceremony where an identity owner, with the help of various components such as web browsers, mobile devices, and other agents, proves to a relying party that they are in control of a DID. This means demonstrating control of the DID using the mechanismspecified in the DID Document's \"authentication\" object. This could take place using a number of different data formats, protocols, and flows. DID Auth includes the ability to establish mutually authenticated communication channels and to authenticate to web sites and applications. Authorization, Verifiable Credentials, and Capabilities are built on top of DID Auth and are out of scope for this document. This paper gives on overview of the scope of DID Auth, supported protocols and flows, and the use of components of the DID Documents that are relevant to authentication, as well as formats for challenges and responses.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Big Brother Watch support the introduction of a Bill to bring greater transparency and safeguards to surveillance powersfor the Intelligence Agencies and law enforcement. However we feel the Investigatory Powers Bill in its current form requires a great deal of work before it is fit to do its job.  2We do not support the use of many of the bulk powers in the Bill and believe there is opportunity to look again at these powers; particularly the use of bulk equipment interference and bulk personal datasets.  We address one of those issues in this submission. 3Far greater clarity is required in the Bill andin the draft Codes of Practice.  Currently the Codes of Practice are riddled with poor drafting, incoherence and lack of clarity.  Indeed, clarity is a concern throughout the Bill, in particularthe definitions of communications datawhichareincomprehensible. We note the drafting has been done toachieve longevity of the Bill, but asthe world becomes more connected it will cause confusion and misunderstandingin the long term. This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. 4Due to the word limit onsubmissions we have chosen to restrict ours to a selection ofamendments which we believe will start the process of ensuringthat privacy is made the backbone of the Bill; a recommendation madeby theIntelligence and Security Committee.  We hope that thisCommittee take that recommendation seriously and ensure the safeguards within the Bill are strengthened.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "In this age of all-digital revolution and at a time when a new landscape for data protection is being redesigned by the draft European Regulation, it is essential for CNIL to conduct a forward-looking strategic activity. It seemed natural for the smartphone to become the very first topic of the CNIL’s strategic planning research, in a world where this device is penetrating ever deeper into everyone’s daily life (7out of ten smartphone users never turn it off!). The first step of the research involved a status assessment of the practices and perceptions of smartphone users regarding the protection of their personal data. Such was the subject of the survey conducted in November 2011. Its results, analyzed in this Newsletter, have since led to the definition of an action plan. The survey findings indeed revealed a new kind of “privacy paradox”: as both a concentrator and a producer of personal data, the smartphone unfortunately remains a ‘black box’ for its owner, while at the same time a pressing need for data protection is emerging... Faced with such opacity, our action plan therefore intends among other to analyze in depth and decipher the ecosystem of smartphones, and to anticipate on future usage trends. Beyond this initial step, CNIL will endeavor to incite the various players in building a framework for more transparent and privacy-friendly products and services\n\n\n\n"

Jointly coordinated by the Department of Studies, Innovation and Foresight and the Communication Department, its success proves that CNIL is on the right track with its open, collaborative approach. The Privacy Camp provided a forum for enthusiastic debate as well as criticism. A number of novel and imaginative proposals emerged, including some put forward by CNIL's innovation laboratory. Discussions focused on tools, practices, and services aimed at helping users learn more about online personal data flows and ‘leaks’ and control privacy online.\n\n\n\n"

They fail to show us the vital role played by culture in our individual and collective lives.Reading a book, listening to music, watching films and TV shows - as well as playing video games, no doubt - over and above their entertainment value, are probably the most suitable spheres for the development and permanent remodelling of our identity. It seems to me that the imaginary space they open up to us is a laboratory, a workshop in which we can compare what we think we are with other possible lives; where we can imagine ourselves with other ways of thinking, feeling, loving or, in short, living out our lives. In other words, it is through our contact with artistic content that we constantly invent and understand the parents, friends, citizens, heroes and lovers that we are or aspire to be.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "People live with all kinds of digital objects. These range from social networks to cutting-edge connected objects. They are now a fully-fledged part of our aesthetic relationship with the world, on a par with architecture or decorative art. A certain widely distributed and highly standardised aesthetic of digital media has been created, producing strong brands in users’ minds. Users are barely aware of this aesthetic, which is well thought out. Conditioning through design pre-empts everything that the individual handles or sees in the digital world.In the wake of Bauhaus, where design is based on the search for functional aesthetics, digital technology has become a relevant field of application in problem-solving. For, beyond the desire to avoid ugliness that “does not sell”, to quote Raymond Loewy, the digital promise is so broad that the functions provided by design seem endless, giving the key players that own them the expectation of a substantial return on investment.Web giants have understood this by competing to attract users, customising their experience, influencing – as subtly and as substantially as possible – their behaviour, in all fields, from leisure to politics. They stand as a compass to navi-gate the abundance of content and the anxiety of the non-optimisation of time.But this model is no longer followed. Maybe because it seems to “take advantage” of individuals, their “malleability” and tendency to become accustomed to simplicity. Concerns regarding personal data are a strong signal of the discomfort felt by users themselves.In this regard, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a major response and a first essential milestone towards greater transparency and a reaction to the crisis of confidence. It offers regulators several legal and technical instruments to make users the focal point of the data economy.But, to fight the model of individuals who are “objects of technology”, design can act as a rampart and deploy its firepower.The aim is not only to make objects beautiful but to propose an aesthetic to support another digital project. This project is not simply functional but humanistic, targeting sustainable goals that users can master; a project more imbued with common sense regarding the real needs of users taken in all their complexity.Prosaically, the aim is not to be deceived, to fully consent to the effort that companies want to relieve us of and ultimately say “yes” together. To do that, in practical terms, the interface is far from cosmetic.Design then reaches its full meaning, that of aesthetics to support humanity. It is beautiful as it is rooted in that humanity.This publication therefore aims to project some ideas to build this digital aesthetic. It addresses the entire digital ecosystem by giving some operational recommendations to strengthen the control and choice to which users are entitled. The CNIL intends to participate in this and considers the attention taken with design solutions as a poten-tial framework on which to build its legal and technical expertise and better fulfil its mission to protect freedoms.\n\n\n\n"

What will become of our digital freedoms in the \"everyone and always connected\" age? And what forms will regulation need to take in order to meet these new challenges? These are the key questions that we put to over forty experts across a range of fields between autumn 2011 and spring 2012. Indeed, with the explosion of personal data viaBig Data, and the proliferation of new uses that consume ever more information, a regulator cannot and should not act alone. It has to listen, exchange and assemble communities of opinions and ideas so as to be able to understand the complex environment within which it operates. The objective of this first edition of the Innovation & Foresight Report, a new CNIL publication, is to bring together these expert opinions. These experts have shared with us their visions – which naturally sometimes differ – of the key transformations and future developments in the field of privacy, freedoms and personal data, and their assessments – all highly instructive - of future forms of regulation. We shall be presenting and endeavouring to understand these visions and assessments, in order to see what use can be made of them by the regulator.\n\n\n\n"

The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  products  can  be  reduced by taking into account environmental issues in product standards. This Guide is intended for use by all those involved in the drafting of product standards, to draw attention to environmental  issues  in  support  of  sustainable  international  trade,  and  is  not  intended  to  be  used  to  create  non-tariff barriers to trade. Standards writers are not expected to become environmental experts but, by using this Guide, they are encouraged to: ⎯    identify   and   understand   basic   environmental   aspects   and   impacts   related   to   the   product   under   consideration, and ⎯    determine  when  it  is  possible  and  when  it  is  not  possible  to  deal  with  an  environmental  issue  through  a  product standard. During  the  life-cycle  of  a  given  product,  different  environmental  aspects  can  be  determined.  However,  the  identification  of  these  aspects  and  the  prediction  of  their  impacts  is  a  complex  process.  When  writing  a  product standard, it is important to ensure that an evaluation as to how products can affect the environment at different stages of their life-cycle is carried out as early as possible in the process of developing the standard. The results of this evaluation are important for specifying provisions in standards. It is anticipated that product standards  writers  actively  consider  compliance  with  any  applicable  national,  regional  or  local  product  related  regulation.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Safety of machinery— Rules for drafting and presentation of safety standards\n\nAs a response to the increased global trade in machinery, the relevant ISO Technical Committees have undertaken publication of a series of related machinery safety standards. It has thus been necessary to develop rules for the preparation, drafting and presentation of such safety standards, supplementing the ISO/IEC    Directives, Part 2, which sets out general principles and requirements for all International Standards.This Guide provides those rules. It is intended for use by Technical Committees writing type-B and type-C standards in the field of safety of machinery (as defined in 3.2 and 3.3). It both makes use of, and refers to, the principles and concepts established in ISO12100, and also takes into account, as far as possible, ISO/IECGuide51.International Standards prepared according to this Guide are intended as a means for supporting national or regional technical regulations (for example, legislation) for machinery safety according to the principles of UNECE Recommendation L. In order that machinery safety standards be able to support these technical regulations, the drafting of the standards can necessitate compliance with specific requirements additional to this Guide, in as far as any such additional requirements are accepted by ISO as not contradicting the content of this Guide. For example, in order to support European legislation, the Guidelines for the implementation of the agreement on technical co-operation between ISO and CEN (Vienna Agreement) are additionally applicable.\n\n\n\n"

As do other users, SMEs benefit from the technical expertise of standards in the elaboration of which they may not have been present. Nevertheless, there are also sometimes advantages to being small as they can adapt quickly, can be more flexible and can have smaller overhead.Furthermore, if standards were to take into consideration the SME perspective, considerable benefits would accrue to all the stakeholders involved in standardization.The aim of this Guide is to raise awareness on the issues that may be of importance to SMEs. By addressing the needs of SMEs, the use of standards may be significantly increased and SMEs will be able to gain the full benefit of utilizing standards.\n\n\n\n"

National bodies that are members of ISO   or   IEC   participate   in   the   development   of   International   Standards   through   technical   committees   established  by  the  respective  organization  to  deal  with  particular  fields  of  technical  activity.

Draft  Guides  adopted  by  the  responsible  Committee  or  Group  are  circulated  to  national  bodies  for  voting.  Publication as a Guide requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. The first edition of this Guide was published by ISO in 1976. It was prepared by the United Nations Economic Commission  for  Europe  (UN/ECE)  in  consultation  with  ISO,  primarily  to  facilitate  the  work  of  the  UN/ECE  aimed  at  removal  of  barriers  to  international  trade  arising  from  lack  of  harmonization  of  standards  or  inadequate international application of standards. The second, thirdandfourth editions of ISO Guide 2 added new terms and definitions in more or less isolated groups, within no overall planned framework. Work on a systematically structured revision was authorized by the ISO Council in 1981 as the principal task of a working group within the ISO Committee on standardization principles (ISO/STACO), including IEC and UN/ECE spokesmen and in cooperation with the ISO Committee on conformity assessment (ISO/CASCO) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Conference (ILAC). The main reason for this activity was a request from UN/ECE for complete and urgent revision of ISO Guide 2 to take into account a number of specific problems raised by the UN/ECE Government Officials Responsible for Standardization Policies as well as the proposed terminology being prepared in the UN/ECE Working Party on  Building.  Moreover,  ISO  was  publishing  an  increasing  number  of  Guides  on  standardization  policies  and  procedures, several of them in conjunction with IEC. To guard against terminological inconsistencies, a clear understanding  of  basic  concepts  needed  to  be  established,  and  unambiguous  general  terms  and  definitions  provided.\n\n\n\n"

Methods for the adoption of International Deliverables other  than  International  Standards  (such  as  Technical  Specifications,  Publicly  Available  Specifications,  Technical  Reports,  Guides,  Technology  Trend  Assessments,  Industry  Technical  Agreements,  International  Workshop  Agreements)  are  given  in  ISO/IEC  Guide  21-2.  Greater  uniformity  in  the  indication  of  both  correspondence and deviations among countries will aid communication, avoid confusion and facilitate trade. 0.2 International   Standards   are   widely   adopted   at   the   regional   or   national   level   and   applied   by   manufacturers,  trade  organizations,  purchasers,  consumers,  testing  laboratories,  authorities  and  other  interested  parties.  Since  these  standards  generally  reflect  the  best  experience  of  industry,  researchers,  consumers and regulators worldwide, and cover common needs in a variety of countries, they constitute one of the important bases for the removal of technical barriers to trade. This has been explicitly acknowledged in the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade of the World Trade Organization (WTO TBT Agreement). It  is  important  that  every  effort  be  made  to  adopt  and  use  International  Standards  as  regional  or  national  standards  and,  consequently,  to  withdraw  conflicting  regional  or  national  standards  as  soon  as  practicable  for  the reasons mentioned above. Only by developing a global approach can the benefits of standardization be fully realized.  However,  full  adoption  may  not  be  practicable  in  all  cases  for  reasons  such  as  regional  or  national  security,  protection  of  human  health  or  safety,  or  protection  of  the  environment,  or  because  of  fundamental  climatic, geographical or technological problems. The WTO TBT Agreement recognizes that these are legitimate reasons for regional or national deviations.\n\n\n\n"

Alongside the growth of international trade, technological and societal cooperation, standards bodies have developed procedures and modes of cooperation which are commonly considered to constitute good practices for standards development at all levels. The use of standards is voluntary unless they are cited as requirements in legislation or in legal contracts.The foundations of ISO’s and IEC’s membership and participation models are at the national level. ISO and IEC, together with their national bodies, are responsible for fostering and ensuring coherence and coordination.The ISO and IEC system for standardization is based on collaboration agreements between ISO and IEC and an extensive array of collaboration agreements among regional, national and other standards bodies\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Guide to the development and inclusion of all aspects of safety in International Standards for medical devices\n\nThis document provides practical guidance to standards writers on how to include safety aspects in the development of medical device standards, including management system standards related to medical devices. This document is based on risk management principles and ISO/IEC Guide 51:2014 to address the needs of the medical device sector.The concept of safety, as described in this document, is closely related to protecting patients who are the subjects of medical care, as well as those persons who provide the care and other potentially affected persons. Safety is also related to harm to property or the environment.The approach described in this document aims to reduce the risk arising during the life cycle of a medical device, including design, production, distribution, installation, use, service, maintenance, and destruction or disposal. The complete life cycle of a medical device (including both the intended use and the reasonably foreseeable misuse) is considered. The goal is to achieve acceptable risk for people, property and the environment.As different circumstances warrant different approaches to ensuring safety, it is impossible to provide precise requirements and recommendations that apply to every case. Examples of such differences are the development of standards for manufacturers of medical devices and standards for health care providers and institutions. However, this document, when followed on a judicious “use when applicable” basis, will help in developing standards that include aspects of safety which are consistent with the generally acknowledged state of the art.NOTE The term “standard” used throughout this document includes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Publicly Available Specifications, Technical Reports and Guides developed by ISO or IEC.\n\n\n\n"

It provides guidance for developing and writing appropriate accessibility requirements and recommendations in standards. However, while its intended audience are standards developers, this Guide contains information that can also be useful to other people, such as manufacturers, designers, service providers and educators.The second edition of this Guide, retitled “Guide for addressing accessibility in standards,” builds upon the edition published in 2001, titled “Guidelines for standards developers to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities”. This edition takes account of developments in thinking and practice which have taken place since 2001 and takes a more inclusive approach. This edition also sets out to improve the usability and adoption of the Guide itself. This Guide, like its predecessor, is intended to be part of the overall framework that standards bodies can use in their efforts to support the development of systems that suit the needs of diverse users.It is an important goal for the whole of society that all people, regardless of their age, size or ability, have access to the broadest range of systems. Issues of accessibility to and usability of systems have become more critical as the number of people (such as older persons, children, persons with reduced abilities and persons with disabilities) with diverse user accessibility needs has increased.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Uncertainty of measurement -- Part 1, Introduction to the expression of uncertainty in measurement\n\nA  statement  of  measurement  uncertainty  is  indispensable  in  judging  the  fitness  for  purpose  of  a  measuredquantity value.  At the greengrocery store the customer would be content if, when buying a kilogram of fruit,the scales gave a value within, say, 2 grams of the fruit’s actual weight.  However, the dimensions of componentsof the gyroscopes within the inertial navigation systems of commercial aircraft are checked by measurement toparts in a million for correct functioning.Measurement uncertainty is a general concept associated with any measurement and can be used in professionaldecision  processes  as  well  as  judging  attributes  in  many  domains,  both  theoretical  and  experimental.   Asthe tolerances applied in industrial production become more demanding, the role of measurement uncertaintybecomes  more  important  when  assessing  conformity  to  these  tolerances.   Measurement  uncertainty  plays  acentral role in quality assessment and quality standards.Measurement is present in almost every human activity, including but not limited to industrial,  commercial,scientific, healthcare, safety and environmental.  Measurement helps the decision process in all these activities.Measurement uncertainty enables users of a measured quantity value to make comparisons, in the context ofconformity assessment, to obtain the probability of making an incorrect decision based on the measurement,and to manage the consequential risks.\n\n\n\n"

The  quantities  involved  might  be  real  or  complex.   Two  approaches  areconsidered for treating such models.  The first approach is a generalization of the GUM uncertainty framework.The second is a Monte Carlo method as an implementation of the propagation of distributions.  Appropriateuse of the Monte Carlo method would be expected to provide valid results when the applicability of the GUMuncertainty framework is questionable.The approach based on the GUM uncertainty framework is applicable when the input quantities are summarized(as in the GUM) in terms of estimates (for instance, measured values) and standard uncertainties associatedwith  these  estimates  and,  when  appropriate,  covariances  associated  with  pairs  of  these  estimates.   Formulæand procedures are provided for obtaining estimates of the output quantities and for evaluating the associatedstandard uncertainties and covariances.  Variants of the formulæ and procedures relate to models for which theoutput quantities (a) can be expressed directly in terms of the input quantities as measurement functions, and(b) are obtained through solving a measurement model, which links implicitly the input and output quantities.The  counterparts  of  the  formulæ  in  the  GUM  for  the  standard  uncertainty  associated  with  an  estimate  ofthe output quantity would be algebraically cumbersome.  Such formulæ are provided in a more compact formin  terms  of  matrices  and  vectors,  the  elements  of  which  contain  variances  (squared  standard  uncertainties),covariances and sensitivity coefficients.  An advantage of this form of presentation is that these formulæ canreadily be implemented in the many computer languages and systems that support matrix algebra.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Uncertainty of measurement -- Part 4, Role of measurement uncertainty in conformity assessment\n\nConformity assessment(see 3.3.1), as broadly defined, is any activity undertaken to determine, directly or indirectly,whether a product, process, system, person or body meets relevant standards and fulfillsspecified  requirements(see3.3.3).   ISO/IEC  17000:2004  gives  general  terms  and  definitions  relating  to  conformity  assessment,  including  theaccreditation of conformity assessment bodies and the use of conformity assessment in facilitating trade.In a particular kind of conformity assessment, sometimes calledinspection(see 3.3.2), the determination that a productfulfils a specified requirement relies on measurement as a principal source of information.  ISO 10576-1:2003 [22] setsout guidelines for checking conformity with specified limits in the case where aquantity(see 3.2.1) is measured and aresultingcoverage interval(see 3.2.7) (termed ‘uncertainty interval’ in ISO 10576-1:2003) is compared with atoleranceinterval(see 3.3.5). The present document extends this approach to include explicit consideration of risks, and developsgeneral procedures for deciding conformity based onmeasurement  results(see 3.2.5), recognizing the central role ofprobability distributions(see 3.1.1) as expressions of uncertainty and incomplete information.The evaluation of measurement uncertainty is a technical problem whose solution is addressed by JCGM 100:2008,theGuide  to  the  expression  of  uncertainty  in  measurement(GUM), and by and its Supplements,  JCGM 101:2008,JCGM 102:2011 and JCGM 103 [3].  The present document assumes that a quantity of interest, themeasurand(see3.2.4), has been measured, with the result of the measurement expressed in a manner compatible with the principlesdescribed in the GUM. In particular, it is assumed that corrections have been applied to account for all recognizedsignificant systematic effects.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "International vocabulary of metrology -- Basic and general conceptsand associated terms (VIM)\n\nIn general, a vocabulary is a “terminological dictionary which contains designations and definitions from one or more  specific  subject  fields”  (ISO  1087-1:2000,  3.7.2).  The  present  Vocabulary  pertains  to  metrology,  the  “science  of  measurement  and  its  application”.  It  also  covers  the  basic  principles  governing  quantities  and  units. The field of quantities and units could be treated in many different ways. Clause 1 of this Vocabulary is one  such  treatment,  and  is  based  on  the  principles  laid  down  in  the  various  parts  of  ISO  31,  Quantities  and  units,  currently  being  replaced  by  ISO  80000  and  IEC  80000  series  Quantities  and  units,  and  in  the  SI Brochure, The International System of Units (published by the BIPM). The  second  edition  of  the  International  vocabulary  of  basic  and  general  terms  in  metrology  (VIM)  was  published in 1993. The need to cover measurements in chemistry and laboratory medicine for the first time, as well  as  to  incorporate  concepts  such  as  those  that  relate  to  metrological  traceability,  measurement  uncertainty,  and  nominal  properties,  led  to  this  third  edition.  Its  title  is  now  International  vocabulary  of  metrology — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM),in order to emphasize the primary role of concepts in developing a vocabulary. In  this  Vocabulary,  it  is  taken  for  granted  that  there  is  no  fundamental  difference  in  the  basic  principles  of  measurement  in  physics,  chemistry,  laboratory  medicine,  biology,  or  engineering.  Furthermore,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  meet  conceptual  needs  of  measurement  in  fields  such  as  biochemistry,  food  science,  forensic science, and molecular biology. Several  concepts  that  appeared  in  the  second  edition  of  the  VIM  do  not  appear  in  this  third  edition  because  they  are  no  longer  considered  to  be  basic  or  general.  For  example,  the  concept  'response  time',  used  in  describing  the  temporal  behaviour  of  a  measuring  system,  is  not  included.  For  concepts  related  to  measurement  devices  that  are  not  covered  by  this  third  edition  of  the  VIM,  the  reader  should  consult  other  vocabularies such as IEC 60050, International Electrotechnical Vocabulary, IEV. For concepts concerned with quality management, mutual recognition arrangements pertaining to metrology, or legal metrology, the reader is referred to documents given in the bibliography.\n\n\n\n"

Privatised firms fared no better than state-owned firms whilst de novo private firms had a considerably superior record relative to other firms with respect to job creation. However, much of this superior performance was related to labour market entry.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "We are writing as civil society organisations working across Scotland and the United Kingdom on issues of human rights and the impact of technologyon fundamentalrights.The use of biometrics in law enforcement is a well-established practice since the development of fingerprinting in the late 19thcentury. Biometrics now extends to but is not limited to DNA, facial search, gait, iris recognition, speech recognition, facial recognition. While useful in preventing, detecting and prosecuting crime, the capturing and storing and searching of biometric identifiers violates individual and group privacy. There is a need to ensure that the use of biometrics identifiers occurs within a governance framework that strikes a balance between public security and fundamental rights to privacy and data protection. It should also be acknowledged that other rights are engaged where this technology is used in public spaces, including the freedom of association and assembly, and freedom of expression.We are supportive of the Scottish Government’s legislation to create a Scottish Biometrics Commissioner. However, the scope of the Biometrics Commissioner is too narrow. Limiting the competencies of the regulator to law enforcement does not reflect the realities of the way biometrics are used in society.\n\n\n\n"

So there is a lot of work and effortsin front of us. 1.But I want to start by saying that it is worthit because the GDPR answers to new needs and trends we collectively have to face.First,  it  answers  to  the  confidence  crisis  that  has  emerged  since  the  last  three  years.  Following  the Snowdenrevelations, but more generally, confidence crisis of the consumers, the individuals, around the relationship they have with you,business representatives, as regard their data.People are more and more unable to understand the complex and fast evolving ecosystem; they feel they are “used” by it and not in a position to make their own choices. They want to be reassured.The GDPR answers to that by putting the individual at the center of the regulation.In particular, by reinforcing their rights or by recognizing new rights like the right to dataportability.\n\n\n\n"

We call this system \"Linked Data Capabilities\", or \"ld-ocap\" for short.The system we propose can work regardless of whether https identifers or DIDs are being used. Since DIDs work nicely with this system and add an additional layer of decentralization we use them for the URIs of this system.\n\n\n\n"

As  a  result,  they  are  responsible  for  a  significant amount of personal information, relating to a number ofintimate and sensitive issues. This entails a huge amount of responsibility, yet our research has found thatin more than a thirdof  all  local  authorities,  personal  information  has  been  lostor  stolen,  often  without encryption or with minimal password protection. This report is part of Big Brother Watch’s continuing campaign to highlight the issues around data  protection  existingin  the  UK,  and  the  largely  unknown  scale  of  how  frequently personal   information   is   wrongfully   accessed,   lost   or   misused. The   growth   of   both commercial and Governmental data collection poses a clear and present risk to privacy, and the  lack  of  adequate  protection  against  this  information  being  compromised  warrants urgent attention.

In this study we are introducing a scalable systemto analyze and predict Android apps’ compliance with pri-vacy requirements. We report on our collaboration with threeregulatory agencies. We present analysis results for 17,991apps. We expect to soon be able to support app store-wideanalysis (i.e., over a million apps) and to track changes innon-compliant behavior over time. Beyond its use by regu-lators and activists our technology is also intended to assistapp developers and app store owners in their internal as-sessments of privacy requirement compliance\n\n\n\n"

In a mobile environment, MSISDN's or ip-addresses are typical resources identifying a user or the respective mobile network operator (MNO). The structure of those identifiers does not allow for an algorithmic normalization. Thus it will be necessary to have a specific service to perform the normalization.\n\nThe OpenID Connect Mobile Discovery Profile specifies the interface of this service. Part of the interface specification will be the identification of possible user input identifier types relevant in the Mobile Connect scenario. Remark: Some of those user input identifier types may not identify a single user/device but may be sufficient to identify the right mobile operator. An example for this is the MNC/MCC tuple (mobile network code/ mobile contry code) or the IP address range.\n\nThis profile also specifies how a client registers with the MNO discovery service and how Account Chooser service [Account.Chooser] can be used to further improve user experience in the overall Mobile Connect flow.\n\n\n\n"

They are built with a particular archetype of what an “entrepreneurial” domestic worker looks like—one who feels at home in the world of apps, social media, and online self-branding—and ultimately replicates and can even exacerbate many of the divisions that came with our predigital workplaces. As platform companies gain growing power over the hiring processes of a whole industry, they will need to actively work against the embedded inequalities in the markets they now mediate.”\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "The Nation’s economic progress and social well-being now depend as heavily on cyberspace assets as on interest rates, roads, and power plants, yet our digital infrastructure and its foundations are still far from providing the guarantees that can justify our reliance on them.  The inadequacy of today’s cyberspace mechanisms to support the core values underpinning our way of life has become a national problem.  To respond to the President’s call to secure our nation’s cyber infrastructure, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the agencies of the Federal Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program have developed the Leap-Ahead Initiative.  NITRD agencies include AHRQ, DARPA, DOE, EPA, NARA, NASA, NIH, NIST, NOAA, NSA, NSF, OSD, and the DOD research labs.) As part of this initiative, the Government in October 2008 launched a National Cyber Leap Year to address the vulnerabilities of the digital infrastructure.  That effort has proceeded on the premise that, while some progress on cybersecurity will be made by finding better solutions for today’s problems, some of those problems may prove to be too difficult.  The Leap Year has pursued a complementary approach: a search for ways to avoid having to solve the intractable problems.  We call this approach changing the game, as in “if you are playing a game you cannot win, change the game!”\n\n\n\n"

Privacy policies are intended to describe the ser-vices’  privacy  practices.  However,  due  to  their  lengthand complexity, reading privacy policies is a challengefor  end  users,  government  regulators,  and  companies.Natural language processing holds the promise of help-ing  address  this  challenge.  Specifically,  we  focus  oncomparing the practices described in privacy policies tothe practices performed by smartphone apps covered bythose policies. Government regulators are interested incomparing apps to their privacy policies in order to de-tect non-compliance with laws, and companies are in-terested for the same reason.We  frame  the  identification  of  privacy  practice  state-ments  in  privacy  policies  as  a  classification  problem,which we address with a three-tiered approach: a pri-vacy  practice  statement  is  classified  based  on  a  datatype (e.g., location), party (i.e., first or third party), andmodality (i.e., whether a practice is explicitly describedas being performed or not performed). Privacy policiesomit  discussion  of  many  practices.  With  negative  F1scores ranging from 78% to 100%, the performance re-sults of this three-tiered classification methodology sug-gests an improvement over the state-of-the-art.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "This report comes at crucial time for the NHS. With increasing amounts of our personal  data  and  information  being  held  by  the  health  service,  their  ability to store it securely and to ensure its safety is coming under growing scrutiny. NHS  Data  Breachesfollows our2011 report, NHS  Breaches  of  Data  Protection Law, which found that for the period July 2008 until July 2011 there were 806 breaches.2The 2014report continues where the last finished, with the findings indicating that far from improvingthe situation has worsened. It is because of this  that  we  are  calling  for  definitive  actionto  deter  such  data  breaches,including the introduction ofcustodial sentences.This  report  should  not  be  taken  as  suggesting  that  the  NHS  is  the  only organisation,  public  or  private,  that  needs  to  improve  with  regards  to  data protection.  Previous  Big  BrotherWatchreports,  such  as Local  Authority  Data Loss,have highlighted that the problem is far more widespread.3It is arguable however, that what is unique  to the NHS is  that the information held  about  patients  by  health  agencies  is  amongst  the  most  personal  and private information that it’s possible to record. If patients have any reason to think that their data isn’t safe within the NHS, then it could lead to a situation whereby  people  stop  reporting  symptoms  or  asking  for  the  necessary  help. This  is  state  of  affairs  that  must  be  avoided  at  all  costs.  For  these  reasons  it deserves special attention and this report should be seen as an urgent wake-up call to the NHS.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "The NIST Privacy Framework is currently under development. NIST envisions that it will be a voluntary tool for organizations to better identify, assess, manage, and communicate about privacy risks so that individuals can enjoy the benefits of innovative technologies with greater confidence and trust.\n\nFor more than two decades, the Internet and associated information technologies have driven unprecedented innovation, economic value, andaccess to social services. Many of these benefits are fueled by dataabout individualsthat flowthrough a complex ecosystem. As a result, individualsmay not be ableto understand the potential consequences for their privacy as theyinteract with systems, products, and services. Organizationsmay notfully realize theconsequenceseither. Failure to manage privacy riskscan have direct adverse consequences at both the individual and societal levels, with follow-on effects on organizations’ brands, bottom lines, and future prospects for growth. Finding ways to continue to derive benefits from data processingwhile simultaneously protecting individuals’ privacy ischallenging, and not well-suited to one-size-fits-all solutions.Privacy is challenging because not only is it an all-encompassingconceptthat helps to safeguard important values such as human autonomy and dignity, but also the means for achieving it can vary.3For example, privacy can be achieved through seclusion,limiting observation, orindividuals’ controlof facets of their identities(e.g.,body, data, reputation).4Moreover, human autonomy and dignity are not fixed, quantifiable constructs; they are filtered throughcultural diversityand individual differences.Thisbroad and shifting nature of privacy makesit difficult to communicateclearlyabout privacy risks within and between organizations and with individuals. What has been missing is a common languageand practical toolthat is flexible enough to address diverse privacy needs.Thisvoluntary NIST Privacy Framework: ATool for Improving Privacy throughEnterprise Risk Management (Privacy Framework) is intended to be widely usable by organizations of all sizes and agnosticto any particular technology, sector, law, or jurisdiction. Using a common approach—adaptabletoany organization’srole(s)in thedata processing ecosystem—the Privacy Framework’s purpose is tohelp organizationsmanage privacy risks by:•Taking privacy into account as they design and deploysystems, products, and servicesthat affect individuals;•Communicatingabout their privacypractices;and•Encouraging cross-organizational workforcecollaboration—for example,amongexecutives, legal, and information technology (IT)—through thedevelopment ofProfiles, selection of Tiers, and achievement of outcomes\n\n\n\n"

The text of the non-paper reflects the comments received at the CEF Telecom Expert Group Meeting of 24 October 2014 on the draft proposal elaborated by DG CNECT and DIGIT with the support of the various Commission services involved in the CEF.\nThis non-paper is organised into two chapters:\n\n*  The first chapter: 'Introduction', clarifies the purpose (Section 1.1), application (Section 1.2) and scope (Section 1.3) of the proposed IT Governance Model;\n* · The second chapter: 'Proposed IT Governance Model', describes what an IT Governance Model is (Section 2.1) and its objectives (Section 2.2). Two sections constitute the core of the non- paper, the principles of governance that underpin the IT Governance Model (Section 2.3) and the model itself (Section 2.4). Finally, this chapter looks at the governance bodies that are proposed to embody the model (Section 2.5) and how they interact with each other (Section 2.6).\n\nThe proposed IT Governance Model will be implemented once it is agreed with the CEF Expert Group and the CEF Coordination Committee.\n\nIn the first months of CEF, EU Member States and associated countries1 (both hereafter referred to under the term 'Member States') raised concerns2 about the IT governance of CEF Digital Service Infrastructures (DSIs) and, in particular, about the governance of the CEF building block DSIs3 as these are going to be reused by several sector-specific DSIs and by projects in policy domains not directly funded by CEF. The Commission shares the concerns of Member States and agrees that the roll-out and take-up of the CEF building block DSIs in different policy domains cannot be based on 'self-organisation' where every DSI works independently of one another. This is why the Commission is putting forward, by means of this draft non-paper, a proposal for an 'integrated' IT Governance Model. The proposed model has been designed according to guiding principles stemming from Regulation 1316/2013 establishing the Connecting Europe Facility (hereafter referred to as 'the CEF Regulation') and Regulation 283/2014 guidelines for trans-European networks in the area of telecommunications infrastructure (hereafter referred to as 'the Guidelines'). The proposed model was also influenced by the work currently being developed in the Electronic Simple European Networked Services (e-SENS) Large Scale Pilot. Once agreed and implemented, the IT Governance Model will promote coherence across CEF building block DSIs and trust between them and the sector-specific DSIs while promoting efficiency and avoiding the duplication of structures. The DSIs are expected to contribute to a fully functioning Digital Single Market for online and communications services in Europe, a priority of the new Commission4 and of the new legislative period for the European Union.\n\n\n\n"

Our  research shows   the   continuing   trend   of the overzealous   use   of   RIPA   by   public authorities, and thedesire to avoid scrutiny by many.Half  a  decade  ago Big  Brother  Watch  was  established  to  helpchallenge policiesthat threaten our civil liberties and shedtransparency on the level ofsurveillance carried  out  by  public  bodies.  Perhaps  more  than any  otherexample,our  work  on the  use  of  the Regulation  of  Investigatory  Powers  Act 2000 (RIPA)embodies both of these principles. Under RIPApublic authorities,such as local authorities and police forces,are permitted to use very intrusive methods of surveillance, for example bugging targets or the use of “covert human intelligence sources” (informers). Attempts  were  made  to  build  a  complete  picture  of  how  RIPA  powers  are being  used  by  police,  with  our Freedom  of  Information request  asking  for details of the use of ‘directed surveillance’, ‘covert human intelligence’and ‘intrusive surveillance’ (covert  surveillance  carried  out  in  residential  premises or  private  vehicles).  However  all  police  forces  rejected  our  request  for information on the second and third questions as  they believe that releasing the information would negatively impact on police capability.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "In November 2015 Facebook's share price broke $100 USD/share, for a total valuation of $290 billion USD. This is evidence that both Facebook and the market understand the value of controlling and leveraging personal data. However, the now-conventional absorb-everything design of Facebook is a blunt one. Employing users as passive producers with no control of their own data only scratches the surface of what is possible with networks of information and identity.Some of these constraints arise from Facebook's centralization, something that tends to worsen as an organization grows in size. There are limits to the amount of trust this sort of centralized authority can garner. This often results in punitive postures: democracies come with the expectation that citizens be forever watchful of their government; while corporations are watched over by regulatory bureaus and further deterred by class-action suits.Decentralized systems that are engineered to prevent concentrating power as they grow avoid this. They can in fact increase their credibility as more users provide their assessments as input. Protocols and structures that are distributed and self-sovereign also offer significantly improved robustness, portability, and versatility than conventional centralized or escrowed processes — especially when combined with secure cryptography.One of the first technologies to offer the advantages of decentralization emerged 25 years ago when the advent of PGP realized a Web of Trust that contained decentralized, cryptographically verified attestations of its users. Unfortunately, failures of UX design confined the spread of PGP to highly technical communities.Today, decentralized Webs of Trust remain as important as ever. Now is the time to extend them to be usable by everyone who has access to digital networks, in particular to marginalized populations that can benefit from the technology. It is a fortunate tragedy that there is no shortage of real-life examples of the need for decentralized Webs of Trust in the world today. A large spectrum of individuals —from marginalized persons like stateless refugees and victims of human trafficking to members of the informal or unregulated economy — urgently need to participate in otherwise privileged economic and political fora, but they face technical, economic, and political barriers to entry.The essential problem is to connect burgeoning new technological developments with unmet consumer needs, and vice-versa. In this paper, we present five use cases: from two relatively simple cases of managing selective disclosure to the most extreme case of establishing government-verifiable credentials from nothing for a stateless refugee.Each case identifies basic technical implementation needs, presents a brief solution sketch, and outlines potential user experience. Afterward, we discuss common themes and summarize future prospects.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "On 11/10/16, our Chief Executive Renate Samson gave evidence to the Public Bill Committee on the Digital Economy Bill about Part 5: Digital Government. You can watch it here or read the Hansard transcript below.\n\nThe Chair: Thank you to our next two witnesses for being here promptly. We will now hear evidence from Big Brother Watch and the Open Rights Group. For this session we again have broadly half an hour to 45 minutes. Will the witnesses please read their names into the record?\n\nJim Killock: I am Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group.\n\nRenate Samson: I am Renate Samson, chief executive of Big Brother Watch. We were also a member of the open policy making group and the Privacy and Consumer Advisory Group, to which Dr Whitley referred to earlier.\n\nThe Chair: Thank you. I turn first to Louise Haigh.\n\nLouise Haigh: I will pick up where we left off, if that is okay. You were both involved in the consultation process for part 5 of the Bill. Did the proposals come as a surprise to you? Do they make sense to you as data experts?\n\nRenate Samson: No, they do not make very much sense, if I am honest. As I said, we were a member of the open policy making process and we also submitted to the consultation. I am genuinely surprised that after a two-year process, all of a sudden it felt very rushed. There were conversations and meetings happening right up to the Queen’s Speech; there was still a general lack of clarity, particularly on safeguards, and many questions were still being asked, such as how, why, when and so on. The next thing we knew, it was in the Queen’s Speech and the Bill was published.\n\nReading through part 5—and I have read through it a lot and scratched my head a great deal, mainly for the reasons given in evidence earlier today—you see that the codes of practice, which would explain an awful lot of what we imagine is meant or may not be meant, just have not been published. I have repeatedly asked for them and been given various expected dates, and we are sitting here today without them but with the Bill already having been laid before Parliament.\n\nWe have also done a lot of work on the Investigatory Powers Bill, for which the codes of practice were there right from the start. There was clarity as to what was intended and what was going to be legislated for, straight up. So, I am profoundly disappointed, because data sharing and digital government are hugely important and we seem to be very far away after a very long process.\n\n\n\n"

Accountability programs, particularly when coupled with school choice models, serve to keep middle and upper middle class families invested in public schools, but in an uneven and patterned way, causing segregated school environments to persist despite racial and socioeconomic residential diversity.\n\n\n\n"

Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201, entitled Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to satisfy the requirements of HSPD 12, approved by the Secretary of Commerce, and issued on February 25, 2005.\n\nFIPS 201 incorporates three technical publications specifying several aspects of the required administrative procedures and technical specifications that may change as the standard is implemented and used. NIST Special Publication 800-73, \"Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification\" specifies the interface and data elements of the PIV card; NIST Special Publication 800-76, Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity Verification\" specifies the technical acquisition and formatting requirements for biometric data of the PIV system; and NIST Special Publication 800-78, \"Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification\" specifies the acceptable cryptographic algorithms and key sizes to be implemented and used for the PIV system.\n\nIn addition, a number of guidelines, reference implementations, and conformance tests has been developed to: implement and use the PIV system; protect the personal privacy of all subscribers of the PIV system; create a PIV \"card\" that is \"personalized\" with data needed by the PIV system to later grant access to the subscriber to Federal facilities and information systems; assure appropriate levels of security for all applicable Federal applications; and provide interoperability among Federal organizations using the standards.\n\nThe release of FIPS 201 marked the beginning of a learn-design-develop-test-validate phase for both the private sector and federal departments and agencies. By 2009, more than 300 standard-conformant products had been developed, validated, and brought to market in support of the PIV card and its infrastructure. Departments and agencies also developed and refined their PIV card issuance processes. PIV card issuance systems are have been operating, and close to 5 million PIV cards have been issued to federal employees and contractors, according to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Today, the emphasis has shifted from PIV card issuance to its deployment and use in logical and physical access applications.\n\n\n\n"

The Climate Strike protest was composed almost entirely of children ofschool age, with many even under the age of 10. There were of course adults present, notleast given the age of some of the children at the protest, however the vast majority of peoplepresent were 18 or under.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "The current Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) camera strategy was first fully rolled out in 2006. Since then there have been serious concerns raised about its privacy implications as well as its proportionality and scope. The number of cameras in the United Kingdom stands at 4368 and looks set to continue to rise. In 2005 Frank Whiteley, then Chief Constable of Hertfordshire Police andHead of the ANPR steering committee,said that the plan was to move from the “low thousands”1of cameras to the “high thousands”2. Financially there has been major investment in ANPR across the country, with forces spending a combined total of £22,495,444 in the past three years. We believe that the use of ANPR cameras should be subject to more rigorous oversight. Cases such as theso called“ring of steel” strategy inRoyston demonstrate that some forces can be over-zealous in their application of this technology. This can lead to huge invasions of privacy and to large numbers of completely innocent members of the public having every part of their journey’s tracked and recorded.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Privacy policies are the primary channel through which companies inform users about their data collection and sharing practices. These policies are often long and difficult to comprehend. Short notices based on information extracted from privacy policies have been shown to be useful but face a significant scalability hurdle, given the number of policies and their evolution over time. Companies, users, researchers, and regulators still lack usable and scalable tools to cope with the breadth and depth of privacy policies. To address these hurdles, we propose an automated framework for privacy policy analysis (Polisis). It enables scalable, dynamic, and multi-dimensional queries on natural language privacy policies. At the core of Polisis is a privacy-centric language model, built with 130K privacy policies, and a novel hierarchy of neural-network classifiers that accounts for both high-level aspects and fine-grained details of privacy practices. We demonstrate Polisis' modularity and utility with two applications supporting structured and free-form querying. The structured querying application is the automated assignment of privacy icons from privacy policies. With Polisis, we can achieve an accuracy of 88.4% on this task. The second application, PriBot, is the first freeform question-answering system for privacy policies. We show that PriBot can produce a correct answer among its top-3 results for 82% of the test questions. Using an MTurk user study with 700 participants, we show that at least one of PriBot's top-3 answers is relevant to users for 89% of the test questions.\n\n\n\n"

Yet  the  technology  that  mediates  the  physician-patient  relationship  today  is  not  directly  purchased or   controlled   by   either   the   physicians   or   the patients.   Electronic   health   records   and   health information   exchange   technology   are   sold   as strategic assets to institutions— typically very large businesses,   that   currently   have   incentives   to maximize  institutional  growth.  We  seek  a  better balance  of  institutional  needs  with  the  needs  of physicians and patients.This  may  also  solve  problems  of  costs.  It  is  widely accepted   that   reducing   healthcare   cost   growth requires  genuine  practice  reform.  Few  institutions, however,  are  planning  to  reduce  their  own  size.  By focusing    health    information    technology    and interoperability on the physician-patient relationship we  bypass  the  inertia  of  institutions,  fertilize  the environment  for  value-based  payment,  and  optimize care  options  among  hospitals,  the  community,  and home, as appropriate.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Some one billion people in the developing world lack proof of legal identity. Living without proof of legal identity is a serious obstacle to social, economic, and political inclusion. It also makes it difficult for an individual to open a bank account, vote, obtain formal employment, access education or healthcare, receive a social transfer, buy a SIM card, or seek legal redress. Furthermore, a person without identification may be unable to exercise the full range of human rights set out in international laws and conventions. Weak civil identification systems also represent challenges for countries such as governance planning, service delivery, public sector administration, collecting taxes, border control and emergency response. As public and private service providers increasingly transition into the digital realm, the ability for individuals to prove who they are will be essential for accessing benefits and services via digital platforms. This move toward digital platforms can increase efficiency of service delivery, create significant savings for citizens, governments, and businesses by reducing transaction costs, as well as drive innovation. This can generate many benefits, but can also exacerbate the risk of isolation for poorly-connected populations including rural and remote communities, the forcibly displaced, stateless persons and other marginalized groups. Leveling the playing field requires a coordinated, sustained effort by countries as well as stakeholders involved in the provision and use of identification systems. A shared vision through this set of common Principles can contribute to robust and universal identification systems that in turn promote social and economic inclusion and sustainable development outcomes.

      "description": "The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 introduced important safeguards in the use of surveillance powers by local authorities. The requirement of prior judicial authorisation is an important change in the law and one we wholeheartedly support. However, as this report highlights, the scope of public surveillance using private investigators risks undermining these protections.  Of particular concern is the number of cases where private investigators have been commissioned, yet their work deemed to not require RIPA authorisation, even in cases where the explanation provided appears to indicate surveillance was undertaken.The law in the UK, particularly the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, is broadly drawnto allow evidence to be introduced in court that inother jurisdictions would not be deemed admissible. Contrasted with the fruit of the poisonous tree provisions in the US, and broader protection offered by the Fourth Amendment, UK law risks failing to join up the evidential admissibility process and the regulation of surveillance.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Semantic Web, 9, 2, Jan 2018\n\nPrivacy policies are intended to inform users about the collection and use of their data by websites, mobile apps and other services or appliances they interact with. This also includes informing users about any choices they might have regarding such data practices. However, few users read these often long privacy policies; and those who do have difficulty understanding them, because they are written in convoluted and ambiguous language. A promising approach to help overcome this situation revolves around semi-automatically annotating policies, using combinations of crowdsourcing, machine learning and natural language processing. In this article, we introduce PrivOnto, a semantic framework to represent annotated privacy policies. PrivOnto relies on an ontology developed to represent issues identified as critical to users and/or legal experts. PrivOnto has been used to analyze a corpus of over 23,000 annotated data practices, extracted from 115 privacy policies of US-based companies. We introduce a collection of 57 SPARQL queries to extract information from the PrivOnto knowledge base, with the dual objective of (1) answering privacy questions of interest to users and (2) supporting researchers and regulators in the analysis of privacy policies at scale. We present an interactive online tool using PrivOnto to help users explore our corpus of 23,000 annotated data practices. Finally, we outline future research and open challenges in using semantic technologies for privacy policy analysis.\n\n\n\n"

Re-cently people have started to turn to Natural Language Pro-cessing (NLP) to automatically extract statements from thetext of these policies. This article reports on a study to eval-uate the benefits of using word embeddings in this endeavor.Specifically, we use 150,000 privacy policies to build wordvectors in an unsupervised manner. This includes evaluatingthe benefits of privacy specific word embeddings. Evaluationis conducted on the OPP-115 corpus of privacy policy anno-tations. By building privacy-specific embeddings we hope toaccelerate research at the intersection of privacy policies andlanguage technologies.\n\n\n\n"

Failure to consider these questions now could leave users vulnerable to a number of threats in the future. Unless devices and services are adequately secured, users will be vulnerable to breaches that could expose intimate information about their bodies and homes to people who were never given permission to access that data. Additionally, without giving users proper notification and obtaining actual consent, users will be unaware of the privacy risks involved in using these technologies and unable to protect the information they consider private.

And she asks: “What do we do now?”\n\n    “Overall, cases where student data has led to harms aren’t about data per se, but about the way that people interact with the data…\n\n    …accidental data leaks, data being hacked, data being lost, school officials using off-campus information for discipline, oversight in planning for data handling when companies are sold, and faulty data and data systems resulting in negative outcomes. Let’s break it down.”\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "The Web of Trust. It’s the buzzword for a new model of decentralized identity. However, it’s also a phrase that dates back almost twenty-five years and has been heavily overloaded with meaning during that time. The classic definition of Web of Trust derives from PGP, but the top Google results refer to a website reputation rating system created by a Finnish internet company. Meanwhile, some use it as a big tent that includes identity authentication & verification, certificate validation, and reputation assessment, while the vibrant blockchain community is also drawing new attention to the classic concept.To build a contemporary Web of Trust, we need to better define it. To do so, we must both understand what the classic Web of Trust was and create a model for the elements of trust that are contained within a more modern definition.\n\n\n\n"

These  difficulties  are  amplified  in  the  case  of  standard  offers  with standard  contracts  thatcustomers are  not  able  to  negotiate.  In  general,  it  is  found  that customers suffer from a lack of transparency on the part of Cloud service providers regarding the  conditions  for  provision  of  the  services,  particularly in  terms  ofsecurity  and knowing whether their data are transferred abroad, and more precisely, to which country.Consequently,  it  is  essential  that  any  French  company  planning  to  use  a  Cloud  computing service  conducts  a  risk  analysis  and  is  very  strict  in  the  choice  of  its  service  provider.  In particular,  the  company  must  take  into  consideration  the  guarantees  offered  by  a  service provider  regarding  the  protection  of  personal  data  and  must  make  sure  that  the  service provider  will  give itall  the  necessary  guarantees  to  fulfil  its  obligations  under  the  Data Protection  Act,  particularly  in  terms  of  information todata  subjects, regulationof  transfers and data security. Note that if it is impossible to negotiate a contract, it is essential to compare the contractual conditions proposed by the different service providers. This allows a choice to be made based on both economicand legal and technical considerations\n\n\n\n"

Our  thesis  is  that  blockchains,  or  more generically  distributed  ledgers,  are  a  potentially powerful new tool for “identity roots” — the starting points for an Internet identity. However “blockchain identity” may not fully address the core security and privacy  principles  needed  in  a  complete  identity system.   In   this   case   DIDs — Decentralized Identifiers rooted on a distributed ledger — may end up  being  a  foundational  building  block  for  higher level identity management solutions.During  this  phase  of  our  work,  we  interviewed industry    experts    in    identity    and    blockchain technology,  both  in  informal  discussions  at  major identity  conferences  as  well  as  in-depth  interviews.

Unfortunately, there is no generalized mechanism that enables verifying that a fetched resource has been deliveredwithout unexpected manipulation. Would it be possible to create an extensible and multipurpose cryptographic link that provides discoverability, integrity, and scheme agility?This paper proposes a linking solution that decouples integrity information from link and resource syntaxes, enabling verifcation of any representation of a resource from any type of link. We call this approach Resource Integrity Proofs (RIPs). RIPs provide a succinct way to link to resources with cryptographically verifable contentintegrity. RIPs can be combined with blockchain technology to create discoverable proofs of existence to of-chain resources.\n\n\n\n"

The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) gave its judgment on 21 December 2016 on the joined cases Tele2 Sverige AB v Post-och telestyrelsen(Case C-203/15) and R (Watson) v Secretary of State for the Home Department(Case C-698/15) (“Watson”), specifying a number of  requirements  that  need  to  be  in  place  for  a Member  State’s data  retention  regime to  be compliant with EU law.The  Government has launched a public consultation on its proposed response to the CJEU’s ruling one year later, on 30th November 2017.\n\nThe Court was clear in Watson that the UK’s current communications data surveillance regime is unlawful in view of EU data protection laws and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Court ruled on two issues in relation to communicationsdata. The first element precludes the  general  and  indiscriminate  retention  of  communications  data.  The  second clarifies  that communications data may only be retained and accessed in relation to fighting serious crime, after  independent  authorisation  has  been  granted,  in  addition  to  other  safeguards.In  light  of the CJEU’s judgment, the UK’s regime urgently requires a serious overhaul.\n\n\n\n"

As a result, the W3C Credentials Community Group, whichhas been incubating the specifcation, will eventually need to hand the specifcation over to the newly formed W3C DID Working Group.

      "description": "The job of the police is to protect usand ina digital society that also meansprotecting our data. Weneed tobe able totrust those in authority with our personal information, unfortunately that trust is being regularly undermined. Safe in Police hands?shows that between June 2011 and December 2015 there were at least 2,315data breachesconducted by police staff. Over 800members of staff accessedpersonal information without a policing purpose andinformation was inappropriately shared with third partiesmore than800times. Specific incidents show officers misusing their access to information for financial gain and passingsensitive information to members of organised crime groups.The findings of the report reveal a number of typesof data breach from improper disclosure of information, accessing police systems for non-policing purposes, inappropriate use of data and accessing data for personal reasons. Data is the driving force of society now, any of the examples highlighted pose athreat to the privacy and security of individuals.\n\n\n\n"

I frst learned about it in Jimmy Song's Programming Bitcoin course, which uses Jupyter to great efect with his open-source curriculum at https://github.com/jimmysong/pb-exercisesHowever, as I went through the class, I had signifcant technical issues with installing and setting up Jupyter and I could see how awesome this would be as a framework for general programming education for folks using JavaScript. Yes, there are some tools, like JSFiddle https://jsfddle.net/ that let you interactively play with JavaScript content, but nothing that combined the static parts of curriculum, like examples, illustrations, and explanations, with interactive parts where you could actually try some code out. It's true that Python is a beauty for working with large numbers like those found in cryptography (and hence cryptocurrency), while JavaScript requires extra work. BUT!\n\n\n\n"

In line with that, Big Brother Watch welcome the work which has been undertaken to ensure that the consumer is aware of the choices they have with regards to their energy data when using a smart meter.  However it is unfortunate thatsome companies are better than others at explainingto their customers theoptions available to them. Indeed some companies are not being completelyclear that a smart meter is an option and not a service the customer has to sign up to.  This is not acceptable.  No customer should be obliged or feel forced to adopt a smart meter if they do not wishto.\n\n\n\n"

It  is  the  first guide we translateinto English. Thisis both a clear sign of our significant investment in IT security and of our commitment to advance the protection of personal data in a globalized international environement.Ever since the birth of Internet, security of personal data has been an issue that has known no borders. Today, this is even more true in a world of extensive externalization and cloud computing, where major cyberattacks make the headlines almost everymonth.The  European  directive  on  the  protection  of  personal  data  unambiguiously  requires  all companies  to  implement  adequate  security  measures  if  they  are  established  in  a  member state or otherwise make use of data processing means situated in Europe. Our commission is  strongly commited to  promote this  principle nationaly,  as  well  as internationaly through increased cooperation with other data protection authorities. As such, this guide should be of  interest  not  only  to  controllers  established  in  France  but  more  generally,to  any  entity that directly or indirectly uses IT systems in our country.In this  context, this  document represents  a  significant  work to  catalogue IT  best  practices when  processing  personal  data  for  small  to  medium-size  companies.  A  collection  of  about fourty  security  measures  are  listed,  allowing  to  assess  the  overall  security  of  the  most common personal data processing requirements.We  are  confident  that  this  work  will  help  improving  the  adoption  of  elementary  best practices.

Third  parties must  now  obtain  explicit  and  documented  consent from people (data subjects) to collect, process, store or  disclose  their  personal  data.  A  specification  for operationalising these regulatory requirements, using digital Consent Receipts, is being developed through the   Consent   and   Information-Sharing   Working Group of the Kantara Initiative.

      "description": "Traditional cryptographic signature systems are based on strictly-defined authentication and authorization mechanisms that assume a single private key can be used to produce a given signature and that a single public key can be used to verify it. Given the evident limitations of this design, we propose an alternative with more powerful capabities, based on the ability to explicitly outline and fully program conditions for verification. These conditions would then be used to determine when a signature or set of signatures can be considered valid.Our inspiration for this authorization system is the bitcoin scripting language, where the authorization to spend funds is explicitly defined within a script, rather than being implicitly defined through the reference to an authorized public key. The largest benefit of explicit specification of authorization conditions is that the system is fully extensible, so new operations can be defined at any time, with the only limitation being the set of operations that the authorization interpreters understand.\n\n\n\n"

We have revealed the thousands of officials able to enter our homes; often without a warrant, and we have lain bare the financial burden of CCTV on council coffers.  Now in Smile you are on Body Worn Camera, Part 1 –Local Authorities, we reveal for the first time that: 54%of all localauthorities across the UK are equipping members of staff or contractors with body worn cameras at a cost of £1,791,960.81.66%of local authorities are failing to completing Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) before deploying the technology and21% of councils are holding non-evidential footage for longer than 31 days; the time limit adhered to by police forces.Body worn cameras are the new tool in the surveillance arsenal. They can be deployed for multiple purposes often with little to no evidence thatthey are the right tool to solve the particular problem.  Big Brother Watch is concerned that the rush to use body worn cameras by local authorities is not being scrutinised closely enough. When we consider that many councils have a poor track records of using heavy handed surveillance tactics and are often lackadaisical with their approach to protecting personal data, scrutiny of new capabilities should be a number one priority.\n\n\n\n"

Off  the  back  of  such  enthusiasm  we  felt  it  necessary  toinvestigatehow  many  police  forces  had invested in the technology, how many cameras were being used by frontline staff and if the benefits lived up to the promisespromulgated by the various groups.Responses  to  our  Freedom  of  Information  request  reveals  that71%have  adopted  the  technology, with a total spend of £22,703,235on 47,922body worn cameras.

      "description": "There is a very important principle to understand that applies directly to the discussion of the use of Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and whether this information should be removed from public documents. This principle is neither controversial nor complicated and should be very easily grasped by almost anyone.\nThe principle is: Identity information cannot be both public and secret.\nNames, by themselves, are not unique and are not a reliable identifier. Without pairing a name with secondary information such as a SSN many false positive and false negative conclusions and outcomes result. In the United States, much of this secondary information, used for the legitimate purposes of identification, comes from public records. The use of SSNs helps to properly identify people. To meet this need, the SSN has been treated as public information and used extensively to link people to their information to conduct legitimate societal functions. Without a clear and complete public record that includes identity information, there cannot be fairness for the blameless or consequences for the culpable.\nThere is a pervasive need throughout society to uniquely identify individuals to facilitate the conduct of business, government, and even social interactions. Without this ability, a government agency cannot ensure it is providing benefits to the proper citizens or that criminals are properly prosecuted. Similarly, financial institutions and employers may wrongly offer or deny credit or employment because of inaccurate credit and background histories.\nPoorly conceived and implemented identity practices have resulted in readily available personal information such as SSNs being inappropriately used as authenticators or “keys” to accounts and other valuable resources. These improper practices have made SSNs valuable to criminals. Current defense mechanisms, when deployed and properly used, competently defend against intrusions based on simple knowledge of SSNs and other personal information.\nInformation such as the SSN that has been public is all but impossible to make secret. Therefore, redacting SSNs and other personal information from public documents will provide virtually no benefit in reducing identity crimes and may hinder or damage current legitimate and successful efforts to do so. Society wide redaction of SSNs and other personal identifiers from public records will be very expensive and disruptive of beneficial processes but will not result in personal information being unavailable.\nResources can be more successfully employed to advance the implementation and use of better identity tools and practices and to educate individuals on how to protect themselves against identity crimes. Redaction cannot, and will not, stop identity theft. When redaction is proposed as the solution to the problem of identity theft, there is only one answer that makes sense: “Just say no.”\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Spectrum of Trust in Data offers a framework for understanding New York City parents’ and guardians’ orientations toward publicly available school data.\n\nData & Society Researcher Dr. Claire Fontaine and Research Assistant Kinjal Dave performed a qualitative, semi-structured, interview-based study with a socio-economically, racially, and geographically diverse group of 30 New York City parents and guardians between May and November 2017. Interviews focused on experiences of school choice; and data and information sources.\n\nThis report illuminates an important gap in common assumptions about the market-driven ecosystem of school choice. Fontaine and Dave find that the data displays produced by the Department of Education (DOE) for parents are for the most part unused, buried on the DOE site, and difficult to comprehend even for those with high information literacy. Instead, parents turn to Google, school websites, and independent school review sites, such as InsideSchools and GreatSchools. Furthermore, the authors find that the information sources that parents favor (InsideSchools and GreatSchools over DOE dashboards) “digest” the data in a way that reinforces the correlation between poverty, minority populations, and low test scores.\n\n\n\n"

It will target key stakeholders who would actively promote SSI adoption. The goal is to create an SSI market roadmap. This roadmap will help SSI leaders, standards bodies, developers, academics, media, and investors coordinate and clarify their messaging for the market, to accelerate the SSI adoption. We illustrate the need for this by summarizing our market strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis), and show how this simple analysis exposes important marketing goals. Further projects will include market explainers, frequently asked questions, market glossaries, market research, and go-to-market (GTM) materials for developers.We wrote this paper to fnd more people who value a healthy SSI market. By working with us on this short-term project, you will help to grow the overall SSI market. Please join us!\n\n\n\n"

However, without concrete data to show a need to prioritize the issue of mental health in schools, there is little incentive to make this issue a priority. Is the failure to account for students with mental illness in a detailed manner the result of stigma? Is it the result of a broader culture that idealizes childhood and is unable to integrate the idea of children struggling with mental illness into our collective consciousness? How might big data be used to identify children in need of mental health treatment in schools to target intervention while protecting students’ privacy? In an age where incredibly detailed information is collected, some students’ needs remain invisible. How can we use the data we have to address the need for the data that is missing?\n\n\n\n"

There are questions, however, about, among other issues, the effectiveness of biometric security measures, usability, and the social impacts of biometric technologies. To address these and other important questions, the NRC was asked by DARPA, the DHS, and the CIA to undertake a comprehensive assessment of biometrics that examines current capabilities, future possibilities, and the role of the government in their developments. As a first step, a workshop was held at which a variety of views about biometric technologies and systems were presented. This report presents a summary of the workshop’s five panels: scientific and technical challenges; measurement, statistics, testing, and evaluation; legislative, policy, human, and cultural factors; scenarios and applications; and technical and policy aspects of information sharing.

While agreat deal of effort has been devoted to solving the phishing problem by prevention and detectionof phishing emails and phishing websites, little research has been done in the area of trainingusers to recognize those attacks.  Our research focuses on educating users about phishing andhelping them make better trust decisions.  We identified a number of challenges for end-usersecurity education in general and anti-phishing education in particular: users are not motivatedto learn about security; for most users, security is a secondary task; it is difficult to teach people toidentify security threats without also increasing their tendency to misjudge non-threats as threats.Keeping these challenges in mind, we developed an email-based anti-phishing education systemcalled “PhishGuru” and an online game called “Anti-Phishing Phil” that teaches users how touse cues in URLs to avoid falling for phishing attacks. We applied learning science instructionalprinciples in the design of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil. In this paper we present the resultsof PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil user studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of thesetools. Our results suggest that, while automated detection systems should be used as the firstline of defense against phishing attacks, user education offers a complementary approach to helppeople better recognize fraudulent emails and websites.\n\n\n\n"

Any multinational company with a diverse workforce would be concerned about limits to international hiring and employee travel. But tech companies should also be concerned about the refugee populations that depend on their digital services for safety and survival.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "D&S fellow Mark Latonero considers recent attempts by policymakers, big tech companies, and advocates to address the deepening refugee and migrant crisis and, in particular, the educational needs of displaced children through technology and app development projects. He cautions developers and policymakers to consider the risks of failing to understand the unique challenges facing refugee children living without running water, let alone a good mobile network.\n\n    The reality is that no learning app or technology will improve education by itself. It’s also questionable whether mobile apps used with minimal adult supervision can improve a refugee child’s well-being. A roundtable at the Brookings Center for Universal Education noted that “children have needs that cannot be addressed where there is little or no human interaction. A teacher is more likely to note psychosocial needs and to support children’s recovery, or to refer children to other services when they are in greater contact with children.” Carleen Maitland, a technology and policy professor who led the Penn State team, found through her experience at Zaatari that in-person interactions with instructors and staff in the camp’s many community centers could provide far greater learning opportunities for young people than sitting alone with a mobile app.\n\n    In fact, unleashing ed tech vendors or Western technologists to solve development issues without the appropriate cultural awareness could do more harm than good. Children could come to depend on technologies that are abandoned by developers once the attention and funding have waned. Plus, the business models that sustain apps through advertising, or collecting and selling consumer data, are unethical where refugees are concerned. Ensuring data privacy and security for refugee children using apps should be a top priority for any software developer.\n\n    In cases where no in-person education is available, apps can still play a role, particularly for children who feel unsafe to travel outside their shelters or are immobile owing to injuries or disabilities. But if an app is to stand a chance of making a real difference, it needs to arise not out of a tech meet-up in New York City but on a field research trip to a refugee camp, where it will be easier to see how mobile phones are actually accessed and used. Researchers need to ask basic questions about the value of education for refugees: Is the goal to inspire learning on traditional subjects? Empower students with academic credentials or job skills? Assimilate refugees into their host country? Provide a protected space where children can be fed and feel safe? Or combat violent extremism at an early age?\n\n    To decide, researchers need to put the specific needs of refugee children first—whether economic, psychosocial, emotional, or physical—and work backward to see whether technology can help, if at all.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "2016, the CNIL adopted a three-year strategic and operational plan with two main goals. First to make the CNIL – which was faced with major quantitative and qualitative pressure due to far-reaching changes in a society entering the digital age – as an agile, comprehensive regulator   committed to joint regulation and inter-regulation. Secondly to create a project to cover an unprecedented period in the Commission’s history: the years in which the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was adopted and came into force.   Three years later, the vision put forward has proved pertinent: thanks to the ongoing commitment of all its teams, the CNIL is extensively repositioned  and  modernised. The strategic plan enabled a better preparation to tackle its missions and carry them out to good effect over the course of 2018, a remarkable year due  to  the  switchover  to  a  new  legal  framework, a new, largely Europeanised mode of personal data governance, and a consequent considerable increase in referrals to the CNIL from private individuals and professionals alike.   Major steps have also been taken in 2019. The new legal framework is now in place and European cooperation has become a reality. Nonetheless, there is still some way to go to complete the transformation and to live by a fully disseminated “information technology and civil liberties” culture all over the country. It is in this context that, in March 2019, the CNIL committed to fresh orientations covering the period 2019-2021. It chose to do so via a progressive, collaborative procedure, involving the Commission’s members, managers and staff, who previously got together in crosscutting workshops to gather collective thought and build final orientations.This strategic roadmap for 2019-2021 sets the priorities for the years to come in order for the CNIL to carry out its public service mission with regards to itsvarious audiences’ expectations, and taking into account both the resources available and the European collective’s requirements.   Following a phase marked by changes and transitions, this roadmap’scommon  thread is appropriation and  achievement, for one and all (private individuals,  professionals  and  the  European  collective  alike),of  all  the  GDPR’s  promises and  potentialitie s.  The  2019-2021 period will  be  decisive  in  lending credibility to the new legal framework and in making the ambitious European challenge an operational success. Civil society and economic players have high expectations. The new model helps raise awareness and lays the groundwork for designing regulatory frameworks across the world. In order to remain an efficient and down-to-earth data regulator in this new context and play its role to the full at national and European level alike, the CNIL must test out theories in practice and continue to modernise. Consequently, it has identifiedfive strategic focuses to guide its action up to 2021.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "D&S researcher Monica Bulger, with Patrick McCormick and D&S research analyst Mikaela Pitcan, writes this working paper detailing the “Legacy of inBloom”.\n\n    Although inBloom closed in 2014, it ignited a public discussion of student data privacy that resulted in the introduction of over 400 pieces of state-level legislation. The fervor over inBloom showed that policies and procedures were not yet where they needed to be for schools to engage in data-informed instruction. Industry members responded with a student data privacy pledge that detailed responsible practice. A strengthened awareness of the need for transparent data practices among nearly all of the involved actors is one of inBloom’s most obvious legacies.\n\n    Instead of a large-scale, open source platform that was a multi-state collaboration, the trend in data-driven educational   technologies since inBloom’s closure has been toward closed, proprietary systems, adopted piecemeal. To date, no large-scale educational technology initiative has succeeded in American K-12  schools. This study explores several factors that contributed to the demise of inBloom and a number of important questions: What were the values and plans that drove inBloom to be designed the way it was? What were the concerns and movements that caused inBloom to run into resistance How has the entire inBloom development impacted the future of edtech and student data?\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "In this primer, D&S researcher Claire Fontaine examines the construct of accountability as it functions in discussions around education reform in the American public education system. The paper considers the historic precursors to accountability, as well as the set of political, economic, cultural, and social conditions that led to test scores becoming the main measure of a school’s success.\n\nIn addition to the historical context around accountability, the paper considers important questions about who accountability serves, what the incentive structures are, and how accountability is gamed and resisted. In short, accountability of what, to whom, for what ends, at what cost?\n\nAbstract:\n\n    There is an ongoing tension in the American public education system between the values of excellence, equity, and a sustained commitment to efficiency. Accountability has emerged as a framework in education reform that promises to promote and balance all three values. Yet, this frame is often contested due to disagreements over the role of incentives and penalties in achieving desirable change, and concerns that the proposed mechanisms will have significant unintended consequences that outweigh potential benefits. More fundamentally, there is widespread disagreement over how to quantify excellence and equity, if it is even possible to do so. Accountability rhetoric echoes a broader turn toward data-driven decision-making and resource allocation across sectors. As a tool of power, accountability processes shift authority and control away from professional educators and toward policymakers, bureaucrats, and test makers.\n\n\n\n"

Bits of media don’t have authority all on their own. They must acquire it through the context that surrounds them. — Alexis C. Madrigal, *The Atlantic*\n\n\n\nTo be alive in 2020 and connected to the immense information network is to experience a rich confusion of images, videos, social-media posts, and reportage about everything, all the time. The latest example: a Ukrainian-airliner crash outside Tehran. The plane, a Boeing 737-800, crashed shortly after takeoff yesterday, killing everyone aboard. There were unconfirmed rumors and general confusion and Twitter threads with videos, pictures, and analysis of what might have happened. (A missile? A malfunction?)\n\nBeyond and next to the tragedy, it felt as if reality had melted and balled up together in one news story. The U.S. strike on an Iranian general last week had tilted the world toward a new precipice. Boeing’s problems with a different model of 737 have been global-headline news. And, of course, Ukraine is also at the center of geopolitics (not to mention American campaigns).\n\nHow could anyone know what had happened? The Ukrainians, Iranians, and Americans were all saying different things (not to mention the Canadians and the British).\n\nThat feeling of the complexity of this globe full of people has condensed into a common idea: Despite all the new information we have access to, we actually know less now. Maybe there has been or will be “an information apocalypse,” where technologically sophisticated fakes lead to a breakdown in general epistemological certainty about anything.\n\n\n\n"

There  are  currently  at  least 51,600CCTV  cameras  controlled  by  434local  authorities  in Britain, up from 21,000 in 19992.  This equates to 1 council owned CCTV camera for every 1200 people in the country.  This is a trebling of council-run surveillance and that is working off a high base –a little over a decade ago were already among the most watched peoples on earth and now local authorities spy on us three times as much.The most often quoted figure suggests that the average British citizen is captured on CCTV 300  times  a  day.   Whether this  is  accurate  or  not,  the  current  economic  climate  should demand  a reconsideration  of the  enormous  spending  on surveillance,  a criticalissue  which councils currently seem determined toignore. As  the  provision  of  CCTV  is  adiscretionary  service,  whichcouncils choose  to  provide,as opposed  to  a  non-discretionary  service  such  as  street-cleaning  or  rubbish  collection,  each CCTV camera puts an additional burden on the taxpayer.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "D&S researcher Monica Bulger, Jonathan Bright, and Cristóbal Cobo investigate why some Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) users organize face-to-face meetings, exploring the hypothesis that meetup invites would reflect students’ learning goals. They also investigate the extent to which these patterns vary between industrialised and developing countries.\n\n    Abstract: Massive open online courses (MOOCs) offer the possibility of entirely virtual learning environments, with lectures, discussions, and assignments all distributed via the internet. The virtual nature of MOOCs presents considerable advantages to students in terms of flexibility to learn what they want, when they want. Yet despite their virtual focus, some MOOC users also seek to create face-to-face communities with students taking similar courses or using similar platforms. This paper aims to assess the learner motivations behind creation of these offline communities. Do these face-to-face meetings represent an added extra to the learning experience, with students taking advantage of the context of the MOOCs to create new personal and professional connections? Or, are offline meetups filling a gap for students who feel that not all learning can take place online? We also assess the extent to which these patterns vary between developing and industrialised regions, thus testing the claim that MOOCs are helping to democratise access to education around the world. Our research is based on a unique source of socially generated big data, drawn from the website ‘meetup.com’, which gives us a data set of over 4000 MOOC related events taking place in over 140 countries around the world over a two year period. We apply a mixed methods approach to this data, combining large-scale analysis with more in-depth thematic hand coding, to more fully explore the reasons why some learners add a ‘real’ component to their virtual learning experience.\n\n\n\n"

We  live  in  a  time  where  our  every  step  can  be,  and  often  is,  recorded.  Whilst  the  world's  largest  companies  are  profiting  from  tracking,  analysing  and  quantifying  every 'consumer', the state is building the most totalitarian style surveillance regime  of  any  democracy  in  history  under  the  Investigatory  Powers  Act  2016.We have long warned of the harms of omnipresent surveillance to society as a whole - and this year, the risk that constant data collection poses to our democracy finally caused public concern after the Cambridge Analytical scandal.

It  tells  the  stories  of  campaigners  and  unionists  who  are  targeted  by  state  surveillance  simply  for engaging in peaceful protest; of people too scared to access healthcare because   of   insidious   government   data   sharing   schemes;   of   welfare   recipients afraid to reap the benefits of social media for fear their posts will be used against them.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Within some public policy and scholarly accounts, human trafficking is increasingly understood as a technological problem that invites collaborative anti-trafficking solutions. A growing cohort of state, non-governmental, and corporate actors in the United States have come together around the shared contention that technology functions as both a facilitator and disrupting force of trafficking, specifically sex trafficking. Despite increased attention to the trafficking-technology nexus, scant research to date has critically unpacked these shifts nor mapped how technology reconfigures anti-trafficking collaborations. In this article, we propose that widespread anxieties and overzealous optimism about technology’s role in facilitating and disrupting trafficking have simultaneously promoted a tri-part anti-trafficking response, one animated by a law and order agenda, operationalized through augmented internet, mobile, and networked surveillance, and maintained through the integration of technology experts and advocates into organized anti-trafficking efforts. We suggest that an examination of technology has purchase for students of gender, sexuality, and neoliberal governmentality in its creation of new methods of surveillance, exclusion, and expertise.\n\n\n\n"

Security is hard for users, administrators, and developers to understand, making it all too easy to use, configure, or operate systems in ways that are inadvertently insecure. Moreover, security and privacy technologies originally were developed in a context in which system administrators had primary responsibility for security and privacy protections and in which the users tended to be sophisticated. Today, the user base is much wider--including the vast majority of employees in many organizations and a large fraction of households--but the basic models for security and privacy are essentially unchanged.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Washington University Law Review, 96, 6, Feb 2019\n\nDespite numerous groups’ efforts to score, grade, label, and rate the privacy of websites, apps, and network-connected devices, these attempts at privacy indicators have, thus far, not been widely adopted. Privacy policies, however, remain long, complex, and impractical for consumers. Communicating in some short-hand form, synthesized privacy content is now crucial to empower internet users and provide them more meaningful notice, as well as nudge consumers and data processors toward more meaningful privacy. Indeed, on the basis of these needs, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as lawmakers and policymakers in the European Union, have advocated for the development of privacy indicator systems.\n\n\n\n"

Such “neutral” systems are supposedly good for implementing legal logic because, like these systems, law relies on binaries in decision-making, removing the gray and fuzzy from the equation. The problem with this formulation is that efficiency is not necessarily desirable, bias is baked into the data sets and reified technically as well as through interpretation, and legal binaries are neither socially productive nor logically sound.\n\nD&S founder danah boyd responds to Margaret Hu’s work in Big Data Blacklisting with supportive arguments that further Hu’s assertions. boyd discusses how procedure and efficiency make algorithmic decision-making so attractive to policymakers and bureaucrats yet flawed systems in place do not make data neutral and in fact ‘blacklists purposefully distance decision-makers from the humanity of those who are being labeled’.\n\n\n\n"

Furthermore, communications between the parties may be only via legacy voice channels. Applicable situations include marine, subterranean, remote expeditions, disaster areas, refugee camps, and high-security installations.

      "description": "D&S researchers Mark Latonero and Monica Bulger, with Bronwyn Wex, Emma Day, Kapil Aryal, Mariya Ali, and Keith Hiatt, completed a thorough study on online child sexual exploitation in South aSIA.\n\n    This study identified an assumption that a technical fix must exist for problems identified as ‘online’. In the case of online child sexual exploitation, these assumptions are true, but limited. INTERPOL and the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) lead efforts to identify and take down CSAM images globally, a technological fix. Yet it is a finding of this study that combined with international response there is also a need for a local response to attend to the victims and perpetrators. Local response to online child sexual exploitation relies on the strength of the existing child protection system, locating treatment of abuse incidents regardless of where they occur, within an existing framework. It additionally addresses that a single child may be victim of multiple forms of abuse and seeking treatment from the same facilities.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Computers are different from hammers because, unlike hammers, they can operate autonomously, manipulate symbols, and modify themselves. This paper analyzes the factor behind the phenomenon of the de-materialization of advanced economies: combinations of electronic hardware and software; considers their heterogeneity as compared to other forms of capital; and seeks to explain the origins of that heterogeneity. Today's computers are examples of an \"intelligent\" capital--a means of production that actively incorporates human capital in physical forms. Their characteristics derive from developments in computing and automata theory that benefited from John von Neumann's research. On this basis the paper shows that intelligent capital is potentially capable of increasing through a process which does not require investment in the traditional sense, and comments on the relevance of this capacity to economic analysis and the study of advanced, \"weightless\" economies.\n\n\n\n"

We call this dynamic refractive surveillance. In other words, collecting information about one group can facilitate control over an entirely different group. In our ongoing study, we investigate this dynamic in the context of retail tracking, to understand how data collection about customers can impact how retail workers are managed.\n\n\n\n"

Power users typically show high levels of activity from the beginning of their participation [13]; though studies have also suggested that power users can also learn as they develop [14]. Does the same hold true for online education? 2) Are power learners crucial for starting and maintaining online education communities? In other contexts, such as Wikipedia editing, active early involvement of a small mass of committed participants is crucial for starting collective activities [8]. Is this also the case when it comes to online education?\n\n\n\n"

However, Caplan and co-writer Philip M. Napoli assert that this argument has led to a misclassification of these companies and such misclassification has profound policy implications.\n\n    A common position amongst online content providers/aggregators is their resistance to being characterized as media companies. Companies such as Google, Facebook, BuzzFeed, and Twitter have argued that it is inaccurate to think of them as media companies. Rather, they argue that they should be thought of as technology companies. The logic of this position, and its implications for communications policy, have yet to be thoroughly analyzed. However, such an analysis is increasingly necessary as the dynamics of news and information production, dissemination, and consumption continue to evolve. This paper will explore and critique the logic and motivations behind the position that these content providers/aggregators are technology companies rather than media companies, as well as the communications policy implications associated with accepting or rejecting this position.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "D&S researcher Monica Bulger, with Patrick Burton, Brian O’Neill, and Elisabeth Staksrud, writes “Where policy and practice collide: Comparing United States, South African and European Union approaches to protecting children online”.\n\n    That children have a right to protection when they go online is an internationally well-established principle, upheld in laws that seek to safeguard children from online abuse and exploitation. However, children’s own transgressive behaviour can test the boundaries of this protection regime, creating new dilemmas for lawmakers the world over. This article examines the policy response from both the Global North and South to young people’s online behaviour that may challenge adult conceptions of what is acceptable, within existing legal and policy frameworks. It asks whether the ‘childhood innocence’ implied in much protection discourse is a helpful basis for promoting children’s rights in the digital age. Based on a comparative analysis of the emerging policy trends in Europe, South Africa and the United States, the article assesses the implications for policymakers and child welfare specialists as they attempt to redraw the balance between children’s online safety while supporting their agency as digital citizens.\n\n\n\n"

As authentication becomes ever more ubiquitous, understanding its interplay with privacy is vital. The report examines numerous concepts, including authentication, authorization, identification, privacy, and security. It provides a framework to guide thinking about these issues when deciding whether and how to use authentication in a particular context. The book explains how privacy is affected by system design decisions. It also describes government’s unique role in authentication and what this means for how government can use authentication with minimal invasions of privacy. In addition, Who Goes There? outlines usability and security considerations and provides a primer on privacy law and policy.\n\n\n\n"

Across  the  country, there  are  in  excess of  500  companies  engaged  in  recovering  unpaid  debts  with  a collective  turnover  of  more  than  £3  billion  per  annum.    In  total,  17  million  debt recovery cases were processed last year1.  In  many  cases,  the  largest  single  customers  of  these  debt  recovery  agencies  are local   councils,   who   use   them   to   recover   unpaid   debts   from   individuals   and businesses based inside  their boundaries.   As  our  report  suggests, more  than a  third of the 17 million cases processed by debt recovery agencies are direct referrals from local authorities.  Backin March 2010, an investigation by the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) revealed that there had been a 30% increase2in the number of people seeking help following aggressive demands from bailiffs for the payment of debts.  After  examining  500  cases  which  had  been  brought  to  them  by  members  of  the public   complaining   about   their   treatment   at   the   hands   of   bailiffs,   the   CAB concluded that:64% of bailiffs were guilty of harassment or intimidation;40% misrepresented their powers of entry;A quarter threatened debtors with imprisonment;and 42% charged excessive fees3.\n\n\n\n"

It’s potentially very important work, and while some other projects (and Google) are working with law enforcement on similar efforts, Latonero’s group isn’t.

Some claim that it will be \nimpossible to enforce these principles in an age characterised by Big Data.4 According to this view, the protection of privacy must primarily be safeguarded through enterprises providing clear and comprehensive information on how personal data is handled. The Working Group is of the opinion, however, that the protection of privacy is more important than ever at a time when increasing amounts of information are collected about individuals.5 The privacy principles constitute our guarantee that we will not be subjected to extensive profiling in an ever increasing array of new contexts. A watering down of key privacy principles, in combination with more extensive use of Big Data, may have adverse consequences for the protection of privacy and other important values in society such as freedom of expression and the conditions for exchange of ideas.\n\n3. Some core principles have been stipulated by the OECD and in the European Data Protection Directive for how personal data may be processed in a reasonable, correct and legitimate manner.6 The following principles in particular are of relevance for Big Data: purpose limitation, relevance and data minimisation, completeness and quality, transparency and right of access to information.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "In April 2004, the Working Group adopted a Working Paper on the potential privacy risks associated 1\nSince that time, due to the strongly increasing dissemination and diversity of mobile devices such as, for example, mobile phones, smart phones, laptops and PDAs, accompanied by the constant avail- ability of public communication networks, data processing of all manner of confidential and personal data on potentially insecure devices in potentially insecure public environments is becoming increas- ingly easy.\nThe use of mobile devices is not solely limited to the maintenance of contact data and processing of calendar entries. Rather, it makes confidential and personal data in corporate databases or the use of cloud computing services easily accessible.\nThe constantly increasing storage capacities of mobile devices and the ever-increasing speed of wireless networks allow mobile data processing in a way that was only possible in fixed and more secure environments in the past. The increased integration of mobile applications in conventional company IT infrastructures and processes increasingly results in confidential, personal, as well as business critical data not just being stored in the central system, but also being processed on the mobile devices. This can have a direct impact on the integrity, confidentiality and security of the data.\nFurthermore, mobile devices are being increasingly used for archiving and temporary storage of data, which entails risks of data loss or disclosure.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Surveillance is the monitoring of behavior, activities, or other changing information, for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting someone or something. It often involves observation of individuals or groups by government organizations, although there are some exceptions, such as disease surveillance, which monitors the progress of a dis- ease in a community without directly observing or monitoring individuals.\nAerial surveillance is the gathering of surveillance, usually visual imagery or video, from an airborne vehicle. Since the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Com-\nmissioners first discussed issues of aerial surveillance by satellites in 19921, there have been far-reaching technological developments. Whereas satellite-based services such as Google Earth at present do not pose particular risks to individual privacy as long as only snapshots with limited resolution of imagery are collected, the situation is different with re- gard to low flying surveillance platforms such as drones. Whereas the use of drones for mili- tary (combat) purposes is the subject of some limited – due to classification - public debate, similar debate about civilian uses of this technology for information collection purposes and their consequences has so far been neglected. The history of satellite technology since 1989 shows however that reconnaissance technology formerly restricted to military use can eventually become available for civilian use as well.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Public policy statements by prominent media organisations have signalled that the era of free online media may be nearing its end. Accordingly, several providers of online services, and specifically online newspapers, around the globe are beginning to offer access to their services exclusively on a fee paying basis.\nThe business models discussed range from subscription services where access would be offered for a monthly fee to „pay per view“ business models where a small amount of money is paid for access to a single informa- tion item (so-called “micropayment”, e. g. for an online newspaper article or video clip).\nIn addition, the latest generation of mobile devices provide the opportunity to install access capability to online media service via so-called „Apps“. Several providers of mobile devices have started to offer their own distribu- tion platforms for such „Apps“, including related payment services.\nAt the same time, so-called „Third-Party Applications“ are becoming increasingly popular in social network services,. Many of these „Third-Party Applications“ are being offered for a fee by a different service provider from the provider of the social network. Facebook, for example, has recently announced the introduction of its own currency „facebook coins“ for paying for services inside its social network.\nThese developments can lead to infringements of the privacy of users of such services, if the basic principles for the protection of privacy are not being taken into account. Indeed, the providers of such micropayment systems have the opportunity to generate advertising revenue by exploiting the detailed personal transactional information that they may capture.\n  Previously, the Working Group has frequently stressed the need for the preservation of anonymity to the larg- 1\nest extent possible as an essential aspect of privacy protection on the Internet . More specifically, the Working\nGroup has underlined the need to maintain the possibility of anonymous access to digital media, and in par- 2\nticular digital television . More recently, these principles have been reconfirmed in the concept of „privacy by 3\n design“ .\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Wearable computing is a term used to describe computer-powered devices or equipment that are small enough to be worn or carried on a user’s body.2 These devices incorporate various types of sensors with different capabilities. For example, sensors have the ability to collect, in real time, in- formation about the user’s body (mood, habits, physical activities, health status, speed, mobility) and the user’s environment (images, sounds, temperature, humidity, location, social environment) as well as computer-generated data to mediate the user’s experience of the world around them.\nMany wearable devices include a camera of some form. Though a camera would only capture some of the above elements, the camera feature is the focus of many current privacy concerns.3 It is the ability of these devices to record, perhaps constantly, and perhaps covertly, that leads to many con- cerns, particularly with respect to the privacy of non-users who may be the subject of those record- ings.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "For many people, email has become the primary means of communication, superseding traditional mail for both domestic and business purposes. An email account which can identify an individual and can be used for personal communications is universally regarded by data protection and privacy authorities as constituting personal data.\nAn individual may have one or many email accounts, which may have been provided via a free or a paid-for service; an employee may also be permitted by his employer to use a business email ad- dress for personal purposes. Apparently “free” email accounts may be packaged in with information services such as broadband services and cable TV.\nSo what happens if an individual needs to change his email service provider?\nThe real-world analogy is with moving house. Normally, when someone moves house, they send out letters to all their business and personal contacts informing them of the new address. In addition, the person will normally arrange with the postal services for all of their mail to be redirected to their new address – not a simple matter as nowadays there may be many postal delivery services involved. The ‘backstop’ is to give the new occupants re-address labels to use for any residual mail that ar- rives.\nIf we translate this real-world analogy into cyberspace then we need to consider any information so- ciety service that involves identifying an individual by name. This can include the increasingly popu- lar social networking services and cyber-trading accounts which use an email address for validation purposes and to which electronically delivered goods and invoices, etc. may be sent. The problem may also manifest itself in the case of SMS messaging associated with mobile phones.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is a technology that automates the inspection1, in real or near-real time, of the header and content portions of data packets being transmitted on networks.\nAn Internet packet or datagram is generally composed of a ‘datagram header’ and a ‘datagram data area’. The datagram header is the portion of the packet that contains information such as source and destination IP address and other details necessary to get the packet where it needs to go as it trav- erses the network. The datagram data area is referred to as the ‘payload’ because it is the content that the datagram header (the ‘envelope’) generally delivers. The packet header refers to any infor- mation a carrier requires to convey its telecommunications message, and the message itself is re- ferred to as the content or payload of that telecommunications message.\nWhile DPI cannot be considered a new technology, having been used for years in intrusion detection and prevention systems as well as in firewall systems, additional uses – enabled by increased com- puting power and more efficient algorithms – for traffic management, control over the dissemination of illegal or unwanted content – including copyrighted material – and even for delivering targeted advertisements to Internet users have been discussed and started to be introduced more recently.\nThe application of this technology can put the privacy of Internet users at risk. In particular, certain uses of DPI technologies by Internet access providers can result in severe infringements of privacy of Internet users. Access providers are the “gateway to the virtual world”; they are technically able to monitor the content of the entire communication of an Internet user. It is therefore essential that Internet access providers respect telecommunications secrecy, as laid down in the legal frameworks of many jurisdictions. In addition, Internet access providers in many cases not only offer Internet ac- cess, but also voice telephony services, as well as access to media, such as cable television. Pro- viders of such “triple play”-services can – technically speaking – gain an even more detailed profile of the communications behaviour of their customers. Furthermore, with the advent of new and inno- vative services like telemedicine, more and more personal data of a particularly sensitive nature (such as health data) may be transmitted through facilities offered by Internet access providers.\nThe Working Group has strong reservations about the application of DPI for any purposes other than maintaining the security of information systems and networks within an organisation2, or as otherwise allowed or required by applicable legislation.\n\n\n\n"

Transparency reporting is useful for promoting trust in organisations with substantial holdings of personal data and contributes to holding public authorities accountable for their practices in seeking access to such data.\n‘Transparency reporting’ is used in this paper to mean the periodic public reporting by data controllers or data processors of statistics, and supporting explanations, of details of personal information released to third parties for non-business purposes. The paper principally focuses upon releases to law enforcement1 and national security organisations without precluding other types of non-business releases.2\nAlthough the paper’s principal focus is upon reporting by private sector organisations involved with telecommunications, the paper’s observations and recommendations may also usefully be relevant to public bodies and to organisations operating outside the telecommunications sector\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "With the ongoing growth of the Smart Grid, the role of the utility is changing. Historically, energy providers focused on maintaining consistent supply at the lowest possible cost; interactions with cus- tomers largely involved billing and minimizing credit risk. However, with the current redesign of elec- trical systems, these interactions are being radically redesigned, as smart meters allow utilities to gain information about the usage patterns of their residential customers at a level of detail that was previously unavailable, and in near real-time. This change is allowing for the development of an ar- ray of new services and efficiencies for both the consumer and the utility.\nTo maintain consumer trust and confidence, the Smart Grid and smart metering will necessitate the emergence of a new relationship between utilities and individuals, centred on customer engagement. Privacy and data security will be the dual cornerstones of this relationship.\n\n\n\n"

That paper depicted the situation as seen by the Working Group at the time: it described emerging services, possible future privacy and security risks, and contained a set of privacy- and security-related recommendations to manufacturers of hardware, software developers and VoIP service providers.\nIn the subsequent 10 years, VoIP has found widespread application by organisations as well as by end users. Furthermore, voice communication has been integrated with a number of other communication technologies, such as instant messaging, text and video. In some regions discussions have already started about phasing out the “Plain Old Telephony System” (POTS), which is now labelled as “legacy infrastructure” by some.\nThe recommendations in this working paper apply to all types of multi-media services, including instant messaging, real-time text, and video services2. This document furthermore makes no distinction between a VoIP service offered by a telecommunication provider and an over-the-top provider. Even if the technology being used by various companies differs, similar privacy and data protection risks remain and therefore the recommendations apply to all.\nIn addition to standardised solutions, there are many proprietary products and services available which provide different degrees of security, data protection and privacy. Unfortunately, non-technical users are often uninformed about the protection provided or are not presented with privacy friendly default settings.\n\n\n\n"
