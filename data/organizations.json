Its headquarters are in Ebene City, Mauritius.\n\nFollowing a proposal for setting up an Internet registry for Africa by several early Internet adopters in Africa, during an INET workshop in Malaysia (1997),  a steering commmitte was set up to work on AFRINIC's structure and business plan. \n\nThe idea behind the initiative was to adapt the allocation policies applied by the already established RIRs (RIPE NCC and APNIC) to Africa’s realities. In 2000 this proposal resulted in a consensus with the setup of AfNOG (the African Network Operators group).\n\nMoreover during the same year, the first AFRINIC observers were appointed to the Address Supporting Organization Address Council (ASO AC). In 2001, the steering commitee recomended the appointment of an initial Board of Trustees based on sub-regional representation. Dr Nii Quaynor chaired the first AFRINIC Board  with the mission to formalise the organisation and work towards its accreditation as a Regional Internet Registry (RIR).\n\nIn 2004, after a selection of potential host countries, AFRINIC was incorporated in Mauritius. It was decided that the Board will consist of elected representatives from the six identified sub-regions in Africa (Northern, Western, Central, Eastern, Indian Ocean and Southern).\n\nAFRINIC was registered in Mauritius with its operations dispersed in South Africa (Technical operations), Egypt (Backup and disaster recovery) and Ghana (Training coordination)\n\n\n\n"

Technology platforms promised us connection: access: and democracy but instead are radicalizing and fragmenting communities by providing an unprecedented ability to coordinate attacks and amplify hate. Five years ago: when relentless harassment in the gamer community against three women game developers happened: underrepresented people sounded an alarm. People of color: the LGBTQIA+ community: and others warned and continue to warn us about how tech platforms are used to abuse: and how it keeps getting worse. In a time where mass shootings have become tragically more commonplace: the recent string of shootings in Gilroy: El Paso: and Dayton have shaken us to our core.\n\n\n\n"

CUB has a leading position in Hungary in some disciplines such as business administration and social science. According to the 2006 Financial Times ranking list of the best 35 business administration schools in Europe, the Faculty of Business Administration occupied 25th place.

As cybersecurity knows no border, the Commission, together with the External Action Service, also fosters cooperation with partners on the global stage.\n\nIn the ePrivacy domain, the main objective is the protection of the confidentiality and the security of communications, which is rooted in the fundamental right to the respect of private and family life (including communications), as enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\n\n\n"

Unfortunately: processing these datasets is often tedious and cumbersome. Organizations follow distinctive practices for codifying datasets. Combining data from different sources requires mapping common entities (city: county: etc.) and resolving different types of keys/identifiers. This process is time consuming and can increase the likelihood for methodological errors.\n\nData Commons attempts to synthesize a single \"Open Knowledge Graph\" (OKG) from these different data sources. It links references to the same entities (such as cities: counties: organizations: etc.) across different datasets to nodes on the graph: so that users can access data about a particular entity aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. Like the Web: the Data Commons OKG is open - any user can contribute datasets or build applications powered by the graph. In the long term: we hope the data contained within the Data Commons OKG will be useful to students: researchers: and enthusiasts across different disciplines. Though we've \"jump-started\" the graph with data from publicly available sources (CDC: US Census: FBI: etc.): we encourage you to join and contribute.\n\nYou can use the Data Commons Graph Browser to browse the graph. The data can be programmatically accessed via APIs. For example usage: check out the tutorials.\n\nData Commons is a project started by Google: and is intended to be a community effort. Get involved!\n\n\n\n"

This data is owned and stored by large private organizations in\nhuge data silos where it is susceptible to selling, tampering, extraction and other\nexploitation. The originator of the data mostly loses control over its data when\nsigning up to various services such as Facebook, Google, Instagram, Snap, Twitter\netc., that offer ‘free’ services in exchange for exploitation of data, e.g. Google’s\nGmail service reading emails and showing targeted ads as a result.\nDatum proposes a network run on a secure smart contract blockchain that allows\nall of its users to retake control of their data, not just the personal and habitual\ndata they produce every day, but also data from the (IoT) devices that they control.\n1\nDatum encompasses the following key elements:\nA fast decentralized data store allowing users to store structured data securely\nrunning on a smart contract blockchain\nThe DAT token enabling this data storage and sharing\nThe data marketplace, enabling individuals to monetize their data on their terms\nDatum leverages BigchainDB and IPFS to provide an infinitely scalable,\ndecentralized data storage backend.\nData storage and data sharing is paid for by the DAT token.\n\n\n\n"

The ability to access, control and use personal data has become a means by which internet companies can drive profits. \n\nThe people who create much of this data have lost control over how it is used. This is a problem.\n\nPeople have lost control of their data. This does not just mean the erosion of privacy and autonomy, it’s also bad for the security of people’s online identity\nThe huge quantities of data produced every day offers the potential for insights which could benefit all of society. With the data controlled by a handful of monopolies, this data is inaccessible to people and organisations who want to create solutions and services for public benefit\nThe monopolisation of data creates economic inefficiencies and inequalities. This threatens to undermine trust between citizens, public institutions, and companies, which is essential for a stable, sustainable and collaborative economy\nThe current digital ecosystem and Internet of Things (IoT) landscape is highly fragmented, with a multitude of non-interoperable vertical solutions, all offering their own set of devices, gateways and platforms, and means of data handling in data “silos”. This fragmentation makes data unmanageable and end users ultimately lose control over it.\n\nHow do we solve it?\nWe believe that people should have a choice about what happens to their digital identity, who uses their data online, and for which purposes.\n\nDECODE is an experimental project to develop practical alternatives to how we use the internet today - four European pilots will show the wider social value that comes with individuals being given the power to take control of their personal data and given the means to share their data differently.\n\nDECODE will explore how to build a data-centric digital economy where data that is generated and gathered by citizens, the Internet of Things (IoT), and sensor networks is available for broader communal use, with appropriate privacy protections.\n\nAs a result, innovators, startups, NGOs, cooperatives, and local communities can take advantage of that data to build apps and services that respond to their needs and those of the wider community.\n\n\n\n"

They will link up national & regional initiatives and boost investment through strategic partnerships and networks.\n\nIndustry is one of the pillars of the European economy – the manufacturing sector in the European Union accounts for 2 million enterprises, 33 million jobs and 60% of productivity growth. We stand on the brink of a new industrial revolution, driven by new-generation information technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data and data analytics, robotics and 3D printing. They open new horizons for industry to become more adventurous, more efficient, to improve processes and to develop innovative products and services. Recent studies estimate that digitisation of products and services can add more than €110 billion of annual revenue in Europe in the next five years.\n\nEuropean industry is strong in digital sectors such as electronics for automotive, security and energy markets, telecom equipment, business software, and laser and sensor technologies. Europe also hosts world-class research and technology institutes. However, high-tech sectors face severe competition from other parts of the world and many traditional sectors and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are lagging behind. There are also large disparities in digitisation between regions.\n\n\n\n"

A number of specific duties of the EDPS are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001. The three main fields of work are: \n* Supervision : the EDPS monitors the processing of personal data in the EU administration and ensures compliance with the data protection rules. The supervisory tasks  range from prior checking processing operations likely to present specific risks, to handling complaints and conducting enquiries.\n* Consultation : the EDPS advises the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council on proposals for new legislation and a wide range of other issues having an impact on data protection.\n* Cooperation : the EDPS cooperates with other data protection authorities in order to promote consistent data protection throughout Europe. The central platform for cooperation with national data protection authorities is the Article 29 Working Party.\n\nThe third leg of EDPS' activities can best be described as cooperation. It covers work on specific issues, such as the interpretation of the EU Data Protection Directive, as well as more structural collaboration together with other data protection authorities. The overriding aim of the EDPS is to promote consistency in the protection of personal data throughout the EU.\n \nThe central forum for cooperation in the EU is the Article 29 Working Party . This is where the national data protection authorities meet to exchange views on current issues, to discuss a common interpretation of data protection legislation and to give expert advice to the European Commission.  \n\nThe EDPS also participates in the work to ensure good data protection in the EU's third pillar, which covers police and judicial cooperation (formerly \"EU's third pillar\"). This includes attending a number of meetings of the Joint Supervisory Bodies with deal with information systems in the area of police and justice. He is also a member of the Working Party on Police and Justice set up by the European Conference to provide advice in the area of law enforcement.\n\nOne of the most important cooperative tasks relates to the large scale IT system Eurodac , where the responsibilities for data protection supervision are shared. The system consists of national units (subject to national law), and a central unit (subject to the EU Data Protection Regulation). It therefore requires a coordinated approach that is developed through biannual coordination meetings organised by the EDPS.\n\n\n\n"

The Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU Wien), the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) and OwnYourData are the project  partners in this project which is funded by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG). Here is a short description of the project:\n\nIn our increasingly digital societies, data is perceived as a key resource for economic growth. Among the highest-valued corporations today, many have business models that are essentially based on data of or about their users. This development has raised serious concerns about individuals’ right to privacy and their ability to exercise control over their own data, as well as about the broader shifts of power between data subjects and data controllers that this development entails. Consequently, European policy makers have passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has imposed stricter regulations on personal data handling practices within the EU.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "The FIDO protocols use standard public key cryptography techniques to provide stronger authentication. During registration with an online service, the user’s client device creates a new key pair. It retains the private key and registers the public key with the online service. Authentication is done by the client device proving possession of the private key to the service by signing a challenge. The client’s private keys can be used only after they are unlocked locally on the device by the user. The local unlock is accomplished by a user–friendly and secure action such as swiping a finger, entering a PIN, speaking into a microphone, inserting a second–factor device or pressing a button.\n\nThe FIDO protocols are designed from the ground up to protect user privacy. The protocols do not provide information that can be used by different online services to collaborate and track a user across the services. Biometric information, if used, never leaves the user’s device.\n\n\n\n"

These topics were chosen due to their significance for the development of future global communications.  Approximately one hundred people from the twelve member organizations participated in the event. \n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) remains a key topic for standardization and attracts interest from industry, public authorities and end users. GSC members reviewed current standardization activities focused on specific applications and use cases, such as smart cities and intelligent manufacturing. They also explored how IoT can help address global challenges such as electricity access in the developing parts of the world.  GSC agreed on the importance of increasing outreach to both end users and industry stakeholders to accelerate the development and adoption of future proof IoT standards. GSC members also addressed the risk of having a fragmented standardization landscape. They concurred that continuing to build on existing collaboration between the various standards setting organizations is vital for accelerating the successful deployment of IoT. \n\n5G will be instrumental in driving the ongoing digital transformation, responding to a wide variety of communication needs.  GSC members discussed current and anticipated standardization and research activities in the 5G area. They noted the importance of engaging both regulators and businesses in the development of 5G and reiterated the need for continued collaboration among SDOs. Managing scarce spectrum resources was highlighted as a particular challenge.  The non-radio aspects were also seen as key to the success of 5G, e.g.  network architecture, integrated control and management, end-to-end performance, fronthaul/backhaul.   They further noted the need to better engage developing countries in standardization efforts. \n\nSmall and Medium-sized Business Enterprises (SMEs) play a critical role in the growth of the global economy.  Standards support innovation, competition and growth by all businesses, particularly SMEs. GSC members shared their experiences on the difficulties and barriers faced by SMEs and discussed ways to foster their involvement in standardization efforts. GSC members agreed that further collaboration and exchange of information on measures to support SMEs is needed. In particular, it was noted that better awareness among SMEs is needed on the benefits and incentives for engagement in SDOs and that efforts to facilitate their participation be promoted.  \n\nGSC members recognized the need, in an increasingly ubiquitous digital environment, to integrate Security and Privacy (Trust) early in the innovation process, by design rather than by mere afterthought.  This requires widely understood principles to be used, in particular relating to identity, which are then applied to the particular technology areas. Further concerted global dialogue and standardization across verticals and across SDOs was highlighted as an urgent priority, with a view to developing consistent and harmonized standards.  Human–centric innovation and standardization, in which both technological and societal considerations work hand in hand, was seen to be in the interest of businesses and consumers alike. GSC members further noted the need to align and adapt existing standards to increasingly diverse security and privacy requirements arising from the advent of IoT, M2M (machine-to-machine), Cloud, big data and smart environments.\n\n\n\n"

Nevertheless, the nature and implications of such orderings are far from clear. What exactly is it that algorithms “do”? What is the role attributed to “algorithms” in these arguments? How can we turn the “problem of algorithms” into an object of productive inquiry?\n\nThis conference sets out to explore the recent rise of algorithms as an object of interest in scholarship, policy, and practice. Taking a fresh view on the current wave of interest in the topic, we aim to discuss themes such as:\n\n    the very idea of “algorithms” as a subject and object of analysis\n    issues of methodology and the kind of knowledge claims that come with algorithms\n    the rhetoric of problems and solutions, in which algorithms are mobilized\n    questions of agency and automation\n    conceptions of secrecy or inscrutability\n    normative concerns\n    rules and regulations surrounding development and implementation\n\nThe conference is over now, but you can still sign up for the Mailing list and enjoy the various Resources we assembled.\n\n\n\n"

These SARPs and policies are used by ICAO Member States to ensure that their local civil aviation operations and regulations conform to global norms, which in turn permits more than 100,000 daily flights in aviation’s global network to operate safely and reliably in every region of the world.\n \nIn addition to its core work resolving consensus-driven international SARPs and policies among its Member States and industry, and among many other priorities and programmes, ICAO also coordinates assistance and capacity building for States in support of numerous aviation development objectives; produces global plans to coordinate multilateral strategic progress for safety and air navigation; monitors and reports on numerous air transport sector performance metrics; and audits States’ civil aviation oversight capabilities in the areas of safety and security.\n\n\n\n"

Joint committees ensure that International Standards combine all relevant knowledge of experts working in related areas.\n\nFounded in 1906, the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) is the world’s leading organization for the preparation and publication of International Standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies. These are known collectively as “electrotechnology”.\n \nIEC provides a platform to companies, industries and governments for meeting, discussing and developing the International Standards they require.\n \nAll IEC International Standards are fully consensus-based and represent the needs of key stakeholders of every nation participating in IEC work. Every member country, no matter how large or small, has one vote and a say in what goes into an IEC International Standard.\n\n\n\n"

LAWtrust understands that trust in business dealings is established through accountability and privacy, which in turn require the establishment of positive identity through verifiable signatures and confidentiality of information. LAWtrust’s solutions are mapped against these business needs so that it can deliver real business value. LAWtrust has a clear vision for trusted identities and securing transaction through its well established Certificate Authority and security integration capacity and capabilities. Focused on meeting globally recognised industry standards to deliver and support its solutions, LAWtrust has in-depth experience and have achieved the following:\n• First Certificate Authority to be accredited for Advanced Electronic Signatures by the Department of Communications under the ECT Act of 2002. This is the South African equivalent of a EU Qualified Signature.\n• Certificate Authority included in both the Adobe and the Microsoft Approved Trust Lists as a Trusted Certificate Authority\n• WebTrust certification and ISO21188 compliant PKI for financial services\n• Provider of the South African National ID PKI, encryption and biometric fraud management systems\nThe key LAWtrust differentiator in this specialist market is its rapid integration middleware called the Trust Service Orchestrator (TSO). This allows organisations to deploy a hybrid model of on-premise and Trust Centre hosted functions which is all accessed through an on-premise service catalog. The TSO handles all the security functions back to the Trust Centre and applies the correct business logic where necessary. An example of this service in action is the LAWtrust Biometric Matching Service which is deployed in banking and government customers. The Biometric Matching service is access through the TSO by any channel (branch, internet etc) and can centrally match the multi modal biometrics through a variety of best of breed vendor algorithms for fingerprint, face, iris and voice matching. The result of the authentication can then be used to unlock a digital certificate/private key hosted on a secure signing service and apply a long term, time stamped digital signature to a document or transaction. Lawtrust also provides a biometric digital signature and evidence system known as eDNA (electronic DNA). This system is the most widely deployed government fraud management system and and ensures that employees are accountable for high risk transactions through a mechanism of biometrically unlocked digital signature after which the system retains all evidence in a time stamped and encrypted vault.\nApart from these major systems, LAWtrust provides the following products and services:\n• SSL certificates\n• PKI (on premise or cloud)\n• Multi factor Strong Authentication\n• Encryption libraries\n• PKI applets\n• Mobile biometrics solutions\n• Consulting and training\nLAWtrust view the involment in the FutureTrust project as beneficial to the African region in keeping abreast with and evolving further, developments in eID, payments and digital signatures within the EU.\n\n\n\n"

The industry’s current solution is an arms race of anti-blockers versus anti-anti-blockers and in some cases alliances with the ad-blockers, themselves. This inefficient counter-productivity inevitably leads to a dead-end. To solve this problem, ad industry and Blockchain experts have combined efforts to create The Mass Network—a Blockchain-based solution aimed at fixing the imbalance of power between the online advertising industry and internet users who unwittingly provide the ad machine its revenue source: data. The Mass proposition is to exchange this wasteful battle for a mutually beneficial, proactive commerce by creating a Blockchain-based marketplace for consumers, webmasters, and data management platforms. Here, the industry pays a fair, market-determined rate to users for their data and attention. This voluntarily provided user information exchanged for compensation presents truly valuable data to the industry when compared to the current ill-gotten and often misinterpreted data harvested at present. To power this network and to create a stable method of exchange Mass will release Mass Coin to the public via a one-time only offering. Once live, average internet users within the system will be paid Mass Coin in exchange for their attention. Mass Coin lives on the Blockchain. It has the same transparency, fluidity, and security of Bitcoin without the dramatic price volatility. Mass paves a way to the monetization of our everyday online experience while improving consumers’ attitudes toward brands, publishers and making advertising more efficient to the benefit of all parties involved. In a world where people's lives are becoming more and more digitized Mass provides a safeguard from exploitation by improving access, integrity, and trust.\n\n\n\n"

The regulation aims at better protecting individuals and increasing accountability of organizations regarding personal data.\n\nGDPR’s best tool is the affirmation of the importance of individual’s consent for the process of its data. Consent is the cornerstone of GDPR. In the meantime GDPR introduces the new right to Data Portability (Art. 20). This new right aims at allowing the individual to make its data circulate easily from one service to another.\n\nThe individual will be able to transfer its data from one service to a competitor service. This is what we call Competition Portability.\n\nThis individual will also be able to transfer its data from one service to a complementary service. This is the Cooperation Portability .\n\nData Portability fosters a digital world where there is no need for online forms anymore.

The result is an extremely dynamic, manageable, cost-effective, and adaptable architecture that gives administrators unprecedented programmability, automation, and control. Implementing SDN via an open standard enables extraordinary agility while reducing service development and operational costs, and frees network administrators to integrate best-of-breed technology as it is developed.\n\nOpenFlow-LogoONF emphasizes an open, collaborative development process that is driven from the end-user perspective. Our signature accomplishment to date is introducing the OpenFlow® Standard, which enables remote programming of the forwarding plane. The OpenFlow® Standard is the first SDN standard and a vital element of an open software-defined network architecture.\n\nToday, our Technical Communities continue to analyze SDN requirements, evolve the OpenFlow® Standard to address the needs of commercial deployments, and research new standards to expand SDN benefits.\n\nFor additional information, please contact us. To learn more about the ONF and our milestones & achievements, please download the All About ONF document.\n\n\n\n"

The association has assumed full responsibility for the development and maintenance of the PEPPOL specifications, building blocks and its services and implementation across Europe.\n\nThe purpose of OpenPEPPOL is to enable European businesses to easily deal electronically with any European public sector buyers in their procurement processes, thereby increasing opportunities for greater competition for government contracts and providing better value for tax payers’ money.\n\nThe Association provides an authoritative point of reference for networks of interoperable, PEPPOL-compliant infrastructure and the organisations that use it, ensuring high level governance and continuation of the agreement infrastructure. OpenPEPPOL is working towards providing its stakeholders with widely accepted technology standards and specifications, while ensuring sustainability and promoting and supporting the wider use of the PEPPOL specifications, building blocks and services.\n\nBusiness to business use of the PEPPOL-compliant infrastructure and use of PEPPOL-components in other areas beyond procurement are also recognised as important and is encouraged by the Association. PEPPOL is currently being implemented in several European countries to date and interest is now increasing outside of the EU.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "From its beginnings 8 years ago, Ouishare has grown into an international network with 60 connectors (highly active members) and hundreds of members in 20 countries throughout Europe, Latin and North America, and the Middle-East.\nIt all started with the vision of transforming the world through sharing, using technology to organize as networks of peers and do business in a more open, collaborative and horizontal way. Inspired by this idea for a better future, a team of young and passionate individuals created Ouishare as an experiment and a quest to do more meaningful work and challenge the status quo.\n\nToday, the members of Ouishare spend a lot of time questioning, experimenting, and deconstructing the myths of our time as well as our own idealistic visions: collaborative practices, shared governance, decentralization, smart cities. We like to move into areas where we are not expected and are always exploring the edges to find new ways to address the many challenges of our time.\n\nWe are best known for our expertise in organizing innovative and participatory events, creating and curating physical spaces that connect diverse ecosystems, and our ability to research and shed light on emerging topics.\n\n\n\n"

IXPs are the places where Internet Service Providers interconnect their networks, to exchange traffic between their customers and create Internet bandwidth. PCH assists in the construction of IXPs, and provides equipment, training, and ongoing support to IXPs and their operators. Over the past twenty years, PCH has helped build more than 150 IXPs, and has provided assistance of some sort to more than half of all the world’s IXPs. PCH also maintains the global directory of IXPs, and publishes statistics about their use and growth.\n\nPCH conducts more than 100 workshops each year on Internet regulatory theory, governance, and economics for audiences ranging from Internet service provider engineers to communications, economic development, and defense ministers. PCH also works in conjunction with and in support of other Internet governance organizations and fora like the global network operators groups, the Internet Governance Forum, the OECD, ICANN, NetMundial, the Regional Internet Registries, and many others. PCH also maintains a global calendar of Internet operations and governance meetings.\n\nPCH has been working since 1995 to make the Domain Name System faster, more scalable, and more resilient against attack. PCH pioneered the use of DNS anycast to distribute DNS load among more servers in more places, anycasting top-level domain nameservers since 1997, and root nameservers since 2001. PCH is the largest authoritative DNS service network in the world, hosting three roots and 280 top-level domains on thousands of servers in more than 100 locations around the world. PCH is also the operator of the only FIPS 140-2 Level 4 DNSSEC signing platform other than the root itself.\n\nPCH is the secretariat and operator of the INOC-DBA critical infrastructure protection hotline communications system, which ties together more than two thousand network operations centers and CERTs in a resilient communications mesh that lets network operators mitigate cybersecurity threats and online crime. PCH also operates a CERT of global scope, and provides training, resources, and assistance to CERTs and governments and communities that wish to form new CERTs. PCH also provides training and resources for national cyber-defense and critical Internet infrastructure protection.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "A human's fundamental right to privacy is increasingly at odds with the eroding status quo of how people's information is collected and used by companies, small and large.\n\nNew digital product and services require an ever increasing amount of data from across a person's life in order to keep pace with the demands of digitally savvy consumers.\n\nOften, these products and services require the collection and processing of highly personal data, driving individuals to fatigue in their attempts to control who has access to their data.\n\nSimilarly, given the complexity of data and new age intelligent systems, it is widely acknowledged that most consumers no longer have the ability to comprehend which of their data has been collected by a company, or how it could / will / has had a positive or negative impact on their life.\n\nThis diminishing level of control, increasing level of consumer fatigue and the abstraction of value have already manifested themselves through data leaks, instances of data misuse on a global scale and the rapid formation of a data oligopoly (Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google).\n\nLaunched in 2017, people.io seeks to redress this balance and create a global ecosystem in which individuals regain control over the access, use and value of their personal data; whilst also enabling the creation of data-centric products and services that put control at their heart.\n\nWhilst not new in its mission, the approach taken by people.io follows a new direction and seeks to reward users for taking control through demonstrating the value and opportunity of control, not the fear and risk of lacking control; bucking the trend of companies that use a person's short term fear to drive the adoption of a specific technology or industry objective.\n\npeople.io launched a Beta app in February 2017, whereby users are rewarded for responding to questions, connecting data sources and engaging with branded content. After hitting the #1 spot on the iTunes UK trending chart, ranking #4 in Lifestyle (just behind Tinder) and launching a co-branded version of their app with Teléfonica Deutschland, a waiting list was implemented and the team reverted back to stealth mode while focussing on Phase Two of their global vision.\n\nIn late 2018, a number of major announcements will be made that re-introduce people.io - as part of an ecosystem of data-centric products designed to empower people while solving some of the fundamental challenges faced by major corporates in their ability to compete with the major tech companies.\n\nTo-date, people.io has received investment from a number of Europe’s most successful entrepreneurs, including Thomas Höegh (Founder of Lovefilm, Arts Alliance and Growth Street) and Nick Robertson (Founder of ASOS) in addition to the Founders Factory and Wayra Deutschland.\n\n\n\n"

It should be a common interest for all the human society to create an existence using the power of IT to support individual human information processing ability, that is, reception, recognition, memory, integration, analysis and expression of the information. Among the technical metabolism, that is, new divices, new representation techniques arising every year based on that interest, we strongly recognize the importance of a persistence layer mainly responsible for memory, in other words, an IT that keeps stablly existing throught individual human lifecycle. What is called PDS today is very close to this. And it had better be implemented in the abstracted layer 'Cloud' or Web API (as opposed to 'Client'), which is relatively free from the metabolism. Such IT for the human society, should not be put under the control of single corporate or individual, but be shared and co-created using the knowledge of many individual or corporate entities. For that to happen, that cloud technology should be open to all the corporates, organizations and individulals over the world. Our mission is to develop and keep evolving such software and grow and nourish the application ecosystem based on it.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "With the advent of accessible digital technology more than a decade ago, international development organizations began seeking new ways of including digital tools in their programming for improved outcomes. These efforts were initially quite successful; significant advancements occurred in various sectors such as health and agriculture, more communities around the globe were connected, and underserved populations were reached in a way that had not been possible before. However, some digitally-enabled programs failed – and quite often that failure was for reasons that were both predictable and preventable.\n\n\n\n"

The icons are based around ascii so that they can appear as embedded graphics or plain text and include a variety of instructions such as \"don't print,\" \"internal use only,\" and \"confidential.\" And, importantly, the instructions can be overridden: we prefer an approach grounded in reminder and courtesy over hard-coded solutions that indiscriminately restrict speech.\n\n\n\n"

Since then it has grown to play a driving role in many different development categories. (A partial and ever-changing list of those, and their occupants, is here.)\n\nVRM stands for Vendor Relationship Management, the customer-side counterpart of Customer Relationship Management, the $48 billion business by which companies attempt to relate to customers (for example through call centers).\n\nDoc sees VRM as “a way to fulfill one of the promises of The Cluetrain Manifiesto” — the widely-cited website and book written in 1999 by Doc and three other authors (one of which is David Weinberger, also of the Center). That promise was embodied in this statement, written by Christopher Locke:\n\n\n\n"

The PSDA gained new functions including the development of public services using innovative approaches. The agency has around 1400 employees, 72 territorial offices around Georgia, 25 Community Centers offering more than 200 public services to the rural population. PSDA services are also delivered through 13 Public Service Halls (larger one-stop-shop service points in major cities) and 70 Express Community Centers (mobile service platforms), planned to cover over 1000 villages by the end of 2015. Nowadays PSDA is increasingly focusing on innovative product and service development with an eye on service quality and expediency. This capacity of PSDA is at the disposal of all public institutions in Georgia, which either have no capacity or find it less feasible to maintain an in-house research and development team. In the context of e-Governance, PSDA can be regarded as one of the core agencies to which well developed egovernance solutions are essential as they underpin the core mission of the organization - to develop improved public services for people and organizations. As part of the broader e-Governance agenda, development of trust services plays an important role. PSDA, as the sole provider of these services in Georgia is thus tasked to introduce necessary measures to ensure continuous advancements of the technology and respective legal base.\n\n\n\n"

The chair for Network and Data Security (NDS), held by Prof. Dr. Jörg Schwenk, is embedded in the Horst Görtz Institute for IT -Security (HGI). The HGI consists of ten groups and is among Europe’s leading research institutions in IT security. Among the HGI’s many accomplishments are one ERC Consolidator Grant (Prof. Eike Kiltz), one ERC Starting Grant (Prof. Thorsten Holz), co-founding of the ECRYPT Network of Excellence I and II (2003- 2012) and Germany’s only DFG research training group (“Graduiertenkolleg”) in cryptography, Challenges for Cryptography in Ubiquitous Computing, headed by Christof Paar. The HGI has organized a large variety of conferences, including Eurocrypt 2009 and CHES 2003. The HGI offers one B.Sc. and three M.Sc. programs in IT security. With more than 150 incoming students annually and over 700 enrolled students, RUB has by far the largest academic programs in security in Germany. RUB strives to provide the best possible environment for research and innovation. RUB and regional partners have thus founded the Project Management Network for Innovation (PMNI) to free its researchers from the requirement of financial and administrative management and create long-standing, stable working relationships with funding authorities. With a strong network of industry partners, RUB is currently in the process of forming the Bochum Institute of Technology (boIT) to effectively address the gap between advanced research results and usable technology on the one hand , and to provide technical project management, as well as, administrative and structural support for research projects on the other hand. PMNI and boIT personnel will symbiotically interact to establish a frictionless environment, where researchers and project partners can focus on their core competencies and projects stay on track.\n\n\n\n"

Through the datatrust, we hope to create a space for \"common data\" that allows sensitive data to be open and shared among researchers, policymakers, application developers, and the general public.\n\nSensitive Data: They have it, we don't.\n\nToday, sensitive personal information is being collected from us by almost every business, organization and institution we interact with. However, we as the public have very little access to it. While businesses use our data to figure out what we'll buy, what we'll eat, and how much debt we'll pay back, the public sector has yet to harness the power of such data for itself. LEARN MORE\n\nWhat should we do? Democratize access.\n\nSome people see this is a problem of privacy. They've advocated giving users more control over how their data is shared, or argued for barring reuses of data.\n\nBut we see this as a problem of power and access. Privacy is definitely a central issue, which is why we've worked hard on developing a measurable privacy guarantee. But we think that by focusing only on radio controls or restricting reuse, we are risking the loss of innovation. The solution is not to shut down data collection, but to democratize access to data in a way that is safe and responsible through the creation of a datatrust.LEARN MORE\n\n\n\n"

They have tricks and heuristics they use to assess the relative difficulty to exploit software, so that they can focus on the easy targets and low hanging fruit. Mudge has had a long career of doing just that (legally, and for research purposes), so he's developed his own personal toolkit of measurements to take when assessing software risk. By consulting with other luminaries of the security field who have extensive exploit development experience, we've been able to build up the list of static analysis metrics and features which we currently assess.\n\n\n\n"

Our expertise in public administration has been enhanced by services with a national and international scope. With the Federal Office for Information Technology founded in 2006, the BVA has been running one of the first IT services centres of the Federal Government. One of the BIT’s tasks is to consolidate the IT systems of the subordinate authorities of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, i. e. to concentrate them in a few selected computer centres. The BVA advises both on modernization of IT based administration processes and on specialised IT issues. About 230 institutions already use BIT products and services, including the Federal Chancellery, the Bundestag, and the federal ministries. Furthermore, a growing number of clients make use of the BIT’s central computer centre. In addition, the BIT assists the Federal Ministry of the Interior in developing IT standards and methods for public administration. As competent authority it examines applications from abroad relating to nationality law and provides a central information tool to the security and migration agencies of the Federal Republic of Germany. By using modern technology, for instance in the Central Register of Foreigners or visa procedure, the BVA assumes important functions in technical and specialised matters in the national and international security architecture. In most cases, registers have high technical and operational requirements, like a high data volume, complex rules, different access rights, and availability around the clock, seven days a week. The functional requirements, however, are similar. More and more registers have to be implemented and maintained at short notice and with limited ressources. This has to be handled with appropriate methods and service-oriented architecture schemes.\n\n\n\n"

It integrates cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things, big data and cloud computing, robotics, artificial-intelligence based systems and additive manufacturing. Compared to previous industrial revolutions, the fourth one is evolving at an exponential rather than at a linear pace.\n\nThis development can potentially raise globe income levels and improve the quality of life for populations around the world. It produces several effects:\n* On the business side: it drastically modifies customer expectations, product enhancement, collaborative innovation and organisational forms. New technologies make assets more durable and resilient, while data and analytics change the way they are maintained.\n* On governments: as new technologies increasingly enable citizens to engage with governments, while governments gain more and more tools to increase their control over population. Governments and legislators must collaborate closely with civil society to be able to properly answer to challenges.\n* On people: one of the greatest challenges is on privacy, on the notion of ownership, consumer patterns and how we devote time to develop skills.\n\nThe European Commission, under the responsibility of the Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, Guenther Oettinger, launched on 19 April a strategy on digitising the European industry.\n\n\n\n"
