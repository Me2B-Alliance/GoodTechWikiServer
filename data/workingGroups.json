      "description": "The IETF has recently developed protocols for use in constrained\nenvironments, where network nodes are limited in CPU, memory and power. \nREST architecture is widely used for such constrained environments.\nIt has been observed that Internet protocols can be applied to these\nconstrained environments, often only requiring minor tweaking and\nprofiling. In other cases, new protocols have been defined to address\nthe specific requirements of constrained environments. An example of\nsuch a protocol is the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).\n\nAs in other environments, authentication and authorization questions\nalso arise in constrained environments. For example, a door lock has to\nauthorize the person seeking access using a \"digital key\". Where is the\nauthorization policy stored? How does the digital key communicate with\nthe lock? Does the lock interact with an authorization server to obtain\nauthorization information? How can access be temporarily granted to\nother persons? How can access be revoked? These types of questions have\nbeen answered by existing protocols for use cases outside constrained\nenvironments, however in constrained environments, additional and\ndifferent requirements pose challenges for the use of various security\nprotocols. In particular, the need arises for a dynamic and fine grained\naccess control mechanism, where clients and/or resource servers are\nconstrained.\n\nThe IETF has a long history in developing three-party authentication and\nauthorization protocols for distributed environments. Examples include\nKerberos, the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), the Authentication,\nAuthorization and Accounting (AAA) infrastructure, and the Web\nAuthorization Protocol (OAuth). All these protocols enjoy widespread\ndeployment on the Internet. Although they all aim to solve a similar\ngoal, at an abstract level, they offer quite different functions and\nutilize different message exchanges. These differences result from the\nmain deployment use cases they were designed for respectively.\n\nRequirements derived from use cases may indicate that existing work is\nuseful as basis for a solution for constrained environments. These \nprotocols, however, were not optimized for constrained environments. \nAdditional requirements that need to be taken into account are the lack \nof a suitable user-interface and the inability of embedded devices to \ncontact an authorization server in real-time with every resource access \nrequest due to intermittent connectivity, etc.\n\nThis working group therefore aims to produce a standardized solution for\nauthentication and authorization to enable authorized access (Get, Put,\nPost, Delete) to resources identified by a URI and hosted on a resource\nserver in constrained environments. As a starting point, the working\ngroup will assume that access to resources at a resource server by a\nclient device takes place using CoAP and is protected by DTLS. Both\nresource server and client may be constrained. This access will be\nmediated by an authorization server, which is not considered to be\nconstrained.\n\nExisting authentication and authorization protocols will be evaluated \nand used where applicable to build the constrained-environment solution. \nThis requires relevant specifications to be reviewed for suitability, \nselecting a subset of them and restricting the options within each of \nthe specifications. Some functionality, however, may not be available in\nexisting protocols, in which case the solution may also involve new\nprotocol work. Leveraging existing work means the working group benefits\nfrom available security analysis, implementation, and deployment\nexperience. Moreover, a standardized solution for federated\nauthentication and authorization will help to stimulate the deployment\nof constrained devices that provide increased security.\n\nOnce progress in identifying suitable candidate solutions has been made,\nthe working group will verify whether the same mechanisms are also\napplicable beyond the use of CoAP and DTLS, which are the two main\nprotocols the group will focus on for access to resources. In \nparticular, the ability to use the developed solution over HTTP and TLS\nwill be investigated. Note that the initial focus is on CoAP and HTTP \nwith DTLS and TLS. Other security protocols may be considered as long as \nthe primary focus is maintained. The group is scoped to work only on the \nweb protocols and data carried within them. Furthermore, to guarantee \nsmooth transition, the integration with existing deployments will be \nstudied, particularly concerning the use of protocol translation \nproxies.\n\nThis work does not make the assumption that the party offering\napplication layer services is always the same party offering network\naccess services. ACE will need to interact with CORE and LWIG to\nensure coordination.\n\nThe working group has the following tasks:\n\n1) Produce use cases and requirements\n\n2) Identify authentication and authorization mechanisms suitable for\nresource access in constrained environments.\n\n\n\n"

Since then, financial institutions have explored the potential of Bitcoin-like systems; the Open Source community has delved into the Open Source implementations, and the research community has worked on developing and optimizing associated cryptographic protocols, improving architectural solutions, and understanding the economics of systems like Bitcoin. Governments have started looking at the regulatory space for distributed financial systems and requirements for integrity; civil society organizations have looked into privacy support in blockchain systems, and law enforcement agencies have examined the new potential for financial crime. As work on exploring all the potential diverse uses of blockchain technology has expanded, applications for e-government, storage, document notarization, identity protection, real estate, and enterprise have emerged.\n\nAt the Paris working group meeting in September 2015, Intel took the initiative to lead a working group on blockchain with an initial focus on crypto-currencies but subsequently broadening out the discussion to be multi-disciplinary. Since then the group has expanded and attracted other TDL members as well as a number of high profile non-members as participants.\n\n\n\n"

The report is designed to help healthcare industry stakeholders entrusted with safeguarding PHI to understand the potentially devastating repercussions of a PHI breach and to provide them with a methodology for determining an appropriate level of investment needed to secure PHI [see related article](https://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&articleid=3173).\n\nThe IDSP also has released workshop reports on best practices for measuring identity theft [see related article](https://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&articleid=2345) and calling for a national identity verification standard [see related article](https://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&articleid=2351). In addition, the panel has produced a comprehensive report for businesses, government agencies, and other organizations in the fight against the theft of personal and financial information [see related article](http://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&articleid=1723).\n\nIDSP workshops typically involve making an inventory of existing standards and industry guidelines in a subject area, identifying gaps where new or updated guidance may be needed, and making recommendations regarding best practices or the desirability and feasibility of undertaking standards development activity. Workshops generally have at least one face-to-face kick-off meeting. While additional meetings may be held, usually much of the work can be accomplished electronically in a working group environment. Workshops culminate in the publication of a report that presents the workshop’s consensus-based findings and recommendations, which in turn may drive future standards development activity. The IDSP itself does not develop standards.\n\nPeriodically, the IDSP has convened plenary meetings which are conferences that include reports on the progress of IDSP work underway, discussion of related identity issues, and exploration of topics that might be suitable for future workshops.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "Distributing and manipulating named information is a major application in the Internet today. In addition to web-based content distribution, other distribution technologies (such as P2P and CDN) have emerged and are promoting a communication model of accessing data by name, regardless of origin server location.\n\nIn order to respond to increasing traffic volume in the current Internet for applications such as mobile video and cloud computing, a set of disparate technologies and distribution services are employed that employ caching, replication and content distribution in different specific ways. These approaches are currently deployed in separate silos – different CDN providers and P2P applications rely on proprietary distribution technologies. It is not possible to uniquely and securely identify named information independently of the distribution channel; and the different distribution approaches are typically implemented as an overlay, leading to unnecessary inefficiency.\n\nInformation-centric networking (ICN) is an approach to evolve the Internet infrastructure to directly support this use by introducing uniquely named data as a core Internet principle. Data becomes independent from location, application, storage, and means of transportation, enabling in-network caching and replication. The expected benefits are improved efficiency, better scalability with respect to information/bandwidth demand and better robustness in challenging communication scenarios. These concepts are known under different terms, including but not limited to: Network of Information (NetInf), Named Data Networking (NDN) and Publish/Subscribe Networking.\n\nICN concepts can be applied to different layers of the protocol stack: name-based data access can be implemented on top of the existing IP infrastructure, e.g., by providing resource naming, ubiquitous caching and corresponding transport services, or it can be seen as a packet-level internetworking technology that would cause fundamental changes to Internet routing and forwarding. In summary, ICN is expected to evolve the Internet architecture at different layers.\n\n\n\n"

All behavioural data are defined as event-based packets. Every packet is connected directly to an individual and can contain a summary of the consent they provided for the processing of the data.

PMRM picks up where broad privacy policies leave off. Most policies describe fair information practices and principles but offer little insight into actual implementation. PMRM provides a guideline or template for developing operational solutions to privacy issues. It also serves as an analytical tool for assessing the completeness of proposed solutions and as the basis for establishing categories and groupings of privacy management controls.\n\n\n\n"

Using this simple model, it allows structured and semi-structured data to be mixed, exposed, and shared across different applications.\n\nThis linking structure forms a directed, labeled graph, where the edges represent the named link between two resources, represented by the graph nodes. This graph view is the easiest possible mental model for RDF and is often used in easy-to-understand visual explanations.\n\n\n\n"

Often working in cooperation with other standards development organizations (SDOs) and various ICT industry consortia, SG17 deals with a broad range of standardization issues.\n\nTo give a few examples, SG17 is currently working on cybersecurity; security management; security architectures and frameworks; countering spam; identity management; the protection of personally identifiable information; and the security of applications and services for the Internet of Things (IoT), smart grid, smartphones, web services, social networks, cloud computing, mobile financial systems, IPTV and telebiometrics.\n\nOne key reference for security standards in use today is Recommendation ITU-T X.509 for electronic authentication over public networks. ITU-T X.509, a cornerstone in designing applications relating to public key infrastructure (PKI), is used in a wide range of applications; from securing the connection between a browser and a server on the web, to providing digital signatures that enable e-commerce transactions to be conducted with the same confidence as in a traditional system. Without wide acceptance of the standard, the rise of e-business would have been impossible.\n\nCybersecurity remains high on SG17’s agenda. Additionally, SG17 is coordinating standardization work covering e-health, open identity trust framework, Near Field Communication (NFC) security, and Child Online Protection.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "The Internet of Things (IoT) suffers from a lack of interoperability across platforms. As a result developers are faced with data silos, high costs and limited market potential. This can be likened to the situation before the Internet when there were competing non-interoperable networking technologies. The Internet makes it easy to develop networked applications independently of those technologies. W3C is seeking to do the same for the Internet of Things.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we need platform independent APIs for application developers, and a means for different platforms to discover how to inter-operate with one another. The approach we are taking is based upon rich metadata that describes the data and interaction models exposed to applications, and the communications and security requirements for platforms to communicate effectively. A further aspect is the need to enable platforms to share the same meaning when they exchange data. We are therefore seeking to enable expression of the semantics of things and the domain constraints associated with them, building upon W3C's extensive work on RDF and Linked Data.\n\n\n\n"

However, behind these impressive numbers, the payment landscape is quickly changing, and new challenges are appearing. For instance, the average shopping cart abandonment rate is 69% across all devices, and even higher on mobile. A variety of factors are limiting the potential of ecommerce, from the high level fraud related to credit card payments, to the fragmentation of payment solutions available on the Web but not available on all merchant sites or on all devices.\nAt the same time, there is a growing interest from businesses to find alternatives to business models based on advertisement. These alternatives include e.g. in-app payments, or micropayments that are today challenging due to a variety of factors such as heterogeneity and number of payment options to support, or the inability for existing payment systems to cope with very small payments.\nIn order to address these issues, and for greater interoperability in the area of payments, the vision behind this activity is to enable: 1) Users to choose their preferred payment solutions across all their devices; 2) Merchants to transparently support a growing number of payment solutions; 3) Developers to monetize applications more easily; 4) New payment solution providers to enter the market more easily with innovative solutions and payment schemes; 5) Society to decrease online fraud; 6) New payment models such as micropayments & paywalls to take-off.\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "The mission of the Web Payments Interest Group, part of the Web Payments Activity, is to provide a forum for Web Payments technical discussions to identify use cases and requirements for existing and/or new specifications to ease payments on the Web for users (payers) and merchants (payees), and to establish a common ground for payment service providers on the Web Platform. The overall objective of this group is to identify and leverage the conditions for greater uptake and wider use of Web Payments through the identification of standardization needs to increase interoperability between the different stakeholders and the different payment methods.\n\n\nThe Web Payments Interest Group's scope covers payment transactions using Web technologies on all computer devices (desktop, laptop, mobile, tablet, etc.) running a Web user-agent (a Web browser, a hybrid app, or an installed Web application) and using all possible legal payments methods. For instance, this includes:\n\n* Traditional payment methods: e.g.credit and debit cards, credit transfer, direct debit, ACH, e-check, prepaid cards, etc.\n* Non-traditional currencies (this term covers multiple cases such as the commonly called cryptocurrencies, digital currencies, or virtual currencies. This category is sometimes designated as \"non-governmental units-of-account\" by some International organizations )\n* Newer front-end payment initiating systems (e.g. various flavors of online digital wallets, contactless payments based on various technologies such as NFC or BTLE)\n* Other value transfer methods such as loyalty points, coupons, etc.\n* New person-to-person payment systems such as Mobile Money in the developing world.\n\nThe Web Payments IG will cover a variety of scenarios including Web-mediated Business-to-Consumer (B2C), Business-to-Business (B2B), Business-to-Business to Consumer (B2B2C), and Person-to-Person (P2P) transactions in the case of physical (payment at physical shops) and online payments for physical or digital goods, including in-app payments. It will also cover one-time payments as well as e.g. recurring bill payments. Finally it will also cover micro-payments (low value payments) in different cases (P2P in international remittances or B2C/B2B for very small value goods such as press articles).\n\nThe tasks that the Interest Group will undertake include:\n* Identification of problems, barriers and challenges that currently exists or may appear in the domain of Web Payments. This includes technology aspects as well as business aspects (incentives, etc.) and covers the different stakeholders, in particular customers (more generally payers), merchants (more generally payees), web application developers, and payment system providers. It also includes legal aspects and the IG will have to ensure that the proposed architecture is flexible enough to cope with varieties of regulations that exist across the globe.\n* Identification of use-cases and scenarios of payment transactions using Web technologies that need to be addressed. This will cover both online payments, off-line payments and payments at physical shops or face-to-face. Issues such as \"floor-limits\" and \"stand-in\" for specific transaction scenarios should be considered. Different categories of use-cases should be identified to highlight different dimensions such as the role of regulations on technologies, the case of international low-value remittances, general retail payments, bill payments, utility payments etc.\n* Identifying ways to improve the usability, security, uptake, and trust of Web payments\n* Identification of requirements for more secure and interoperable management of payment transactions on the Web. This includes the identification of areas and places where standards are needed to ensure interoperable interfaces between Web applications and payment systems.\n* Identification of the issues related to user privacy protection, user data protection, as well as provision of user data required for regulation or for anti-fraud detection process. This covers also rules, regulations and APIs related to access to accounts.\n* Identification of gaps in Web Technologies that do not allow the identified requirements to be met.\n* Identification of the role and place of regulations in the overall payment process, and the requirements that regulations impose on technologies to ensure that they are usable all over the world under different regulatory regimes. Different use-cases from different regions of the World should highlight the implication of the different regulations, and the best way to ensure that technologies can be flexible enough to cope with these regulations. Different use-cases and dimensions will be investigated including terms of the payment service between payers, payees and intermediaries, or cross-border payments.\n* Priorization of the work items to resolve the identified gaps.\n* Review of deliverables under development by other W3C groups that are relevant to the IG scope and report bugs as appropriate.\n* Liaison with other organizations in the payment industry that are using Web Technologies for their technical specifications and/or their services to foster alignment and interoperability on a global scale.\n\nNote:\n* Development of technical standards is not in scope for the Interest Group. However, this group will encourage the development or adaption of technical standards to bridge the gaps that are identified. This includes the provisions of requirements and liaisons with relevant W3C and external groups and organizations. See the Dependencies and Liaison section.\n* The Group will consider the security, privacy and accessibility implications of its use cases and requirements, and seek appropriate review.\n\n\n\n"
